## OE Workshop 2020 - a common infrastructure for PKCS#11-based code signing (Jan LÃ¼bbe)

> Many upstream components integrated via OpenEmbedded already support cryptographic signatures for authentication (kernel, FIT images, update artifacts, boot images).
>
> There is already some existing support for signing using keys stored in the file-system (uboot-sign.bbclass, meta-rauc's bundle.bbclass, meta-secure-core). In larger projects, there is often the requirement to support more secure key storage devices such as HSMs (Hardware Security Modules).
>
> Fortunately, support for the standard API to use keys on hardware tokens (PKCS#11) is widespread by now. We can use this API and SoftHSM (a PKCS#11 simulator) to decouple individual packages from the key configuration. This simplifies testing, as almost the same code is used during development with keys loaded from the file-system and during release with a real HSM.
>
> Jan will present his implementation (a single .bbclass) and some example packages. He is looking for feedback, additional use-cases and testing.
