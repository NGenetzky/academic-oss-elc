## Tutorial: Spelunking for Hardware Data - Matt Porter, Konsulko Group

> This tutorial will introduce students to the process of discovering hardware information necessary to develop device driver software. Students will gain an understanding of how to navigate schematics, datasheets, SoC reference manuals, and the Device Tree binding documentation to extract the pertinent data for use in a device driver. A detailed example using a production hardware platform will be used to illustrate the discovery process and students will have an opportunity to test this process with additional hardware spelunking exercises.
