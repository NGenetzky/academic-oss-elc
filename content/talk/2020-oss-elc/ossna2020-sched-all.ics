SUMMARY:CIP Kernel Team Activities to Accomplish Super Long Term Support - Masashi Kudo\, Cybertrust Japan Co.\, Ltd. & SZ Lin\, Moxa Inc.
DESCRIPTION:CIP (Civil Infrastructure Platform) project aims to support industrial-grade systems in secure and reliable manners. CIP kernel team was launched in 2016 under CIP to provide and maintain Linux kernel for 10+ years\, because life cycles of such industrial-grade systems are very long by their nature.By steadily releasing SLTS (super long-term support) kernel based on LTS4.4 and LTS4.19\, the team has continuously improved the release processes and tools to facilitate the team activities. The team works with LTS and other open source projects to share its findings and contribute outputs. Also\, test automation has been strengthened. During the long support period of 10+ years\, a large number of minor releases are planned\, so the cost reduction effect by test automation will be enormous. Open source tools like "cip-kernel-sec" and "classify-failed-patches" were introduced to track the status of CVEs and to identify patches needed to apply to stable kernel\, respectively.This presentation updates CIP kernel team activities\, by featuring collaborative works with LTS \, status of test automation using KernelCI and LAVA\, and experiences of using the open source tools.

SUMMARY:Invest in Mainline Linux: Choose Your Own Adventure - Dexter Travis\, Precision Planting
DESCRIPTION:Can a small company do big Linux? It is a common belief that a small company does not have the resources required to implement and maintain a fully custom Linux system. And so\, some believe that the need for vendor support binds them to vendor kernels. Five years ago\, Precision Planting boldly endeavored to break through these boundaries. This is the story of how a small team at a small company made the leap to a custom\, chip-level system running mainline Linux\, a courageous choice that enabled Precision Planting to disrupt the agriculture industry. That team would like to share with you what they have learned during the process. Come and learn: when and where to use SOMs\, when and where to utilize vendor kernels\, and how the open source community enables this effort. Your company can build unique and diverse products using mainline Linux.

SUMMARY:Yocto Project LTS Releases - Nicolas Dechesne\, Linaro & David Reyna\, Wind River
DESCRIPTION:Many projects struggle between the requirements for Long Term Support (LTS) and cadence delivery\, the balance between stability versus agility and resources.The Yocto Project is an open source project from the Linux foundation which provides tools and processes to build Linux systems. The Yocto Project makes releases every six months\, and each release is maintained by the Yocto Project for a period of one year. This works great for keeping a tight integration loop with upstream. However the release cadence and the amount of changes that occur in each release make it less than ideal for certain markets. LTS releases have been one of the main feedback from our ecosystem for some time.In this talk we will review the process behind this decision which is most likely the biggest change in the project since its inception. We will present how it will be implemented\, how member organizations participated through the Yocto Project Advisory Board\, discuss the potential impact on the Yocto Project ecosystem\, and address the lessons learned in addition to the expected shortcomings and challenges.

SUMMARY:Learning Event Streaming Processing with Pac-Man - Ricardo Ferreira\, Confluent
DESCRIPTION:Since Pac-Man was originally released in the '80s\, it has been a beacon of fun and joy for people of all ages. What few people know is that this game can also be used to inspire developers on how to build event streaming applications. In this near-zero-slides talk\, attendees will get to see the game being deployed in a cloud provider straight from the GitHub repository\, and once deployed play with the game to generate events. As they play\, the presenter will build from scratch a scoreboard using ksqlDB -- an event streaming technology built out of Kafka Streams. Finally\, an serverless API will be used to monitor in near real-time the computed aggregated statistics from the game\, revealing whoever is the most proficient Pac-Man player in the room.

SUMMARY:Image Signal Processing (ISP) Drivers & How to Merge One Upstream - Helen Koike\, Collabora
DESCRIPTION:Image Signal Processing (ISP) units are hardware accelerators attached to camera sensors. Coming with more and more features\, ISPs are essential nowadays for phones and tablet devices\, capable of capturing pictures with high quality resolution and several image effects and filters.The Media subsystem in the kernel offers a framework and defines APIs for ISP drivers to be upstreamed. There are different ways to model the hardware and expose its capabilities and features to userspace through a Media topology\, which reflects the complexity of the hardware. Cameras are becoming more and more complex\, making it necessary for drivers in userspace\, and this is where the libcamera project comes into play.In this talk\, Helen will share a bit of her experience upstreaming the Rockchip ISP1 driver\, going over the topics mentioned above\, also comparing with other ISPs hardware/driver architectures and sharing tips and lessons learned along the way\, to hopefully be useful for other willing to upstream another ISP driver.

SUMMARY:Linux GPIO: Evolution and Current State of the User API - Bartosz Golaszewski\, BayLibre
DESCRIPTION:Over the last couple years the GPIO sub-system has evolved significantly both in kernel- as well as in user-space. Certain bad design decisions made in the past - namely using a global numberspace for GPIO lines - had led to several problems that were finally addressed with the introduction of the provider-consumer\, descriptor based API in the kernel and with the character device and the corresponding library - libgpiod - in user-space.The GPIO character device has been extended with new features in linux v5.5 and final new additions before declaring it feature-complete are planned for v5.6 & v5.7. The goal of these changes is to gradually move people away from the deprecated sysfs interface as well as non-upstreamable\, SoC-specific solutions (e.g. /dev/gpiomem in RPi kernel) by providing users with appropriate replacement interfaces.This talk will briefly go through the basics of libgpiod and the character device (which have been already presented in the past) but mainly focus on the new features: support for pull-up and pull-down resistors\, configuration changes on requested lines\, the GPIO aggregator and finally the new ioctl() for monitoring state changes of GPIO lines.

SUMMARY:IoT Root of Trust: Knowing Who We Are and Who We Trust - David Brown\, Linaro
DESCRIPTION:When an IoT device connects to the cloud\, how do we know it is a device we should trust? How do we know the device is running the intended firmware. How does the device know that it can trust the cloud service? How does the lifecycle of a device affect its identity. The bootloader plays a key role in establishing this trust.In this presentation\, David Brown will cover the notion of trust and identity as it relates to the initial bootloader. What is meant by “root of trust”. The talk will cover various aspects of identity\, including: secure boot\, attestation\, device identity\, and provisioning. Although MCUboot will be used for specific examples\, the presentation is generally applicable.

SUMMARY:Journey to the Test - Experiences in Getting Serious About Testing Apache Traffic Server - Alan M. Carroll\, Verizon Media
DESCRIPTION:Several years ago increasing code complexity\, community turn over\, and wider use of Apache Traffic Server (ATS) were causing reliability issues in production use. The community decided to make this a high priority for future efforts. The payoff from taking testing and reliability as first class objectives is now evident This talk is about that journey\, looking at the tools used\, the tools built\, and the improvements from that work. Ongoing and future efforts will be discussed\, because testing remains a critical part of delivering a reliable product. All of these tools are available for other open source projects and almost all for any project.ATS is a C++ project and therefore these tools focus on C++ code support\, although many of them are applicable to other languages. These include* Catch for unit testing.* AuTest for black box testing.* Coverity\, clang for static analysis.* Using different compilers for cross checking.* Use of continuous integration for driving testing.* Community efforts and outreach to promote testing and testability.* Lessons learned from failed efforts.

SUMMARY:Bridging the Gap - Linux in Safety Critical Systems - Elana Copperman\, Mobileye
DESCRIPTION:The mission of ELISA (Enabling Linux in Safety Applications) is to promote Linux in safety critical systems\, by providing a common set of tools and processes that can help companies demonstrate that a Linux-based system meets the necessary safety requirements for certification.Safety standards often seem to conflict with the open source mindset. We aim to bridge this gap by providing the technical capabilities to qualify deployment of Linux-based software in safety critical applications.Working closely with the Linux kernel development community\, on the one hand\, and safety experts\, on the other hand\, we identify the existing safety gaps in the current Linux development process. We propose a suite of enhancements (patches\, features\, test frameworks) to support a safety qualified kernel image.We will go into some technical details of our initial safety suite\, and aim to reach out to developers of safety applications to expand on it.

SUMMARY:2020 Trends in Enterprise Open Source Programs - Alex Williams\, The New Stack & Chris Aniszczyk\, CNCF
DESCRIPTION:Open source programs (also known as OSPOs) are now largely driven by engineering teams instead of attorneys — and created to refine engineering practices and attract developer talent\, according to the 2019 open source program survey conducted by The New Stack\, The Linux Foundation’s TODO Group\, and VMware. Open source license compliance has long served as a reason for companies to start formal open source programs. But that’s changing as automated tools improve code scanning and compliance.In this talk\, Alex Williams\, Founder and Publisher of The New Stack\, will release for the first time the brand new results of the TODO Group’s 2020 survey and present top takeaways for how companies are building OSPOs today to best harness open source culture and best practices.What does the research say about open source programs? Which companies and industries are creating them and how are they approaching it? What are the advantages and challenges? And what best practices should companies follow to help advance open source communities as well as their own commercial products? We'll use data to help answer these questions.

At its heart is the idea of making the 55 year mainframe platform open\, simple and familiar so that non mainframers can use Zowe to perform their day to day development or system programming tasks. In addition\, just an operating system is only as good as the apps that build and ship on top of it\, Zowe is a layered framework that can be extended by plugins that benefit from base capabilities such as single sign on or shared certificate management\, but interface with commercial or in-house systems.This talk will cover Zowe from all angles showing how the base function operates and can be installed\, how it works with Visual Studio and can be used as part of a devops pipeline and how Zowe works alongside Node.js\, Jenkins\, Python and other open source languages in an enterprise.The talk will also cover how open Zowe is with its governance with public meetings\, open source in github with ZenHub git issues\, squad formation\, and how anyone no matter how small an individual or large a corporation can participate in Zowe and help shape the future of mainframe tools for the next 55 years.

SUMMARY:Building FOSS Software On ARM64 and ppc64le - Lance Albertson\, OSU Open Source Lab & Peter Pouliot\, Ampere Computing
DESCRIPTION:The vast majority of FOSS has their software targeted for the x86 CPU architecture. However there are several other popular CPU architectures that are becoming widely used in the ecosystem. Architectures such as ppc64le (PowerPC Little Endian) and aarch64 (arm64) are both becoming widely used in cloud\, HPC\, mobile and IoT markets. However free access to these architectures can be difficult for many FOSS projects due to the cost and maintenance involved. To tackle this problem\, the OSUOSL has partnered with IBM and Ampere Computing to provide free access to both architectures using OpenStack as the base platform.This session will cover the history of the creation of both of these resources\, why it’s important to provide access to these architectures\, the technical challenges we faced and how FOSS projects are utilizing each cluster.

SUMMARY:What If ... We Open Source Mentorship? - Guedis Cardenas\, Chief
DESCRIPTION:Since mentorship means different things to people and there is no current one size fits all approach\, what if ... we applied open source principles and technologies to mentorship?Mentorship is at the heart of fostering inclusive\, collaborative and innovative communities. It simultaneously helps the mentee\, the mentor and our community as a whole. However\, despite its benefits and progress made\, mentorship is still not accessible to all.This presentation will explore how we can better share strategies\, resources\, peer advice\, community support\, and connect the wonderful\, broader mentorship initiatives going on. Additionally\, how can we build services\, APIs\, and tooling that accelerate mentorship endeavors. Something built by the people\, for the people -- empowering mentors\, mentees\, and those looking to get started.Learn about the progress made so far and how you + open source principles and technologies can make mentorship a more accessible and inclusive experience.

SUMMARY:Building a Secure\, Efficient\, Compliance OSS Supplychain at Scale - Tan Zhongyi (Jerry Tan)\, Baidu
DESCRIPTION:FOSS projects are heavy used in every enterprise，but if some oss project report a high CVE risk or a easy coredump bug\, how to push over 10\,000+ engineers to fix this issue asap across 100\,000 repos?Building a secure/efficient/compliance supply chain at scale is very challenge.The OpenChain Project provides a great framework for addressing this challenge head-on and we are implementing it in my company. With a use-case of massive open source projects\, many engineers with both good and bad habits\, and limited legal or engineering resources\, the only solution is to automate as much as possible and deploy effective training.I worked with security\, legal and internal tech committees and run with small steps. Adding scripts to check when a developer begins to review code helps prevent unsafe code from being committed in the first place. Indexing every repo with automated tools also provides benefits\, such as allowing the repos to be cleaned within three working days of a CVE alert. This actions come together to provide much greater efficiency than before.

SUMMARY:Living on the Edge: Pure Open Source AI Stack with Panfrost\, GStreamer and Tensorflow Lite - Marcus Edel & Aaron Boxer\, Collabora
DESCRIPTION:The current machine learning hardware landscape is dominated by Nvidia and its closed-source CUDA ecosystem. Although AMD's ROCm software is a growing rival\, Nvidia is still the market leader by a wide margin. Open Source machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow\, PyTorch and mlpack rely on this closed stack to accelerate learning and inference\, locking developers in.Can we give freedom of choice back to machine learning developers?The new Panfrost open source driver for Mali GPUs is solving this problem on the Edge by enabling a fast and efficient machine learning stack running pure open source.In this talk\, we will walk through the process of building a computer vision pipeline on top of a completely open-source inference stack: open-source GPU driver\, machine learning framework and machine learning models. We will also share what we have learned about optimizing these models to run fast on resource-constrained hardware such as the Rockchip RK3399.

SUMMARY:Open Source Cloud Platforms Demystified: Kubernetes\, Cloud Foundry & Knative - Matthias Haeussler\, NovaTec Consulting GmbH
DESCRIPTION:Containers\, applications\, functions: When deploying workloads to cloud platforms\, developers have various OSS options. This talk focusses on Kubernetes and compares how Cloud Foundry and Knative relate to it and also how they can extend and improve it.I’ll compare and contrast the latest experiences of those platforms in order to extract a meaningful comparison from a developer perspective\, providing answers to the following questions:How simple and user-friendly are they? Where are the differences/where are the overlaps? How mature are the individual solutions? Which type of workloads are suitable for which platform?Additionally\, I’ll measure and compare key metrics that affect the developer experience (e.g.\, time to deploy\, time to scale\, and more). The overall goal is to better understand what makes each individual useful in the best way and how they can work together. Each technology will be shown with live demos.

SUMMARY:BuzzCrate: Webscaled Shoebox - Jason Plum\, GitLab\, Inc & Will Christensen\, DAO Technologies
DESCRIPTION:Cheap DevOps CI/CD Kubernetes cluster in a box (or two) on your desk. Based on cost effective ARM single board computers that can be easily extended on the cheap. This development cluster allows an organization on a small hardware procurement (cheaper than a laptop) to have their multi-agent cluster without the need of a data center or monthly cloud provider bill. But what if you do want to deploy to the cloud after?BuzzCrate demonstrates how to make a Rancher k3s-based kubernetes cluster in a shoebox\, utilizing simple to understand deployment tools\, then expands upon that for deploying to cloud providers like Linode. The focus will be allowing a basement lab concept to move into the cloud\, as one may outgrow their ARM hardware or physical space at home\, with the same level of ease.BuzzCrate will take people from a cluster of ARM boards to a cloud provider simply and easily. Using configuration management\, we’ll give a similarly easy method to deploy to Linode. Once completed\, the challenge of multiple architecture support and how to publish the containers to a project with GitLab will be demystified.

SUMMARY:Opkg: Debian's Little Cousin - Alejandro del Castillo\, National Instruments
DESCRIPTION:Opkg is a lightweight package management system designed for embedded devices. It provides most of dpkg/rpm functionality at a fraction of the size. Open Embedded distributions use it extensively\, as well as other resource-constrained distributions\, like OpenWRT.On this talk we will cover the project architecture\, as well as the design decisions that make opkg highly customizable\, enabling trade-offs of speed/space. The talk will also cover the solver backend plugin mechanism\, which was developed as a way to re-use existing dependency solver technologies\, instead of maintaining a custom one. The backend currently supports libsolv\, a very popular library used by other package managers (dnf\, hawkey). The talk will explain the basics of libsolv\, and how it leverages SAT solvers in the dependency package management space. It will also cover differences between the libsolv solver and the old internal solver one.Finally\, Alejandro will share some thought on the future of the project\, challenges and work ahead.

SUMMARY:DIY Smart Home Demonstration and How-to Using FOSS - Kathy Giori\, MicroBlocks
DESCRIPTION:Rather than give your smart home device data\, and voice commands used to control them\, to large tech titans\, this talk shows that you can maintain complete privacy using open source software and tools. The open source WebThings Gateway by Mozilla protects users by not sending data nor commands outside the home. Remote management is secured by https\, so you only need an https-capable web browser to log in.Smart home devices that communicate over IP\, including web cameras\, Wi-Fi smart plugs\, and smart assistants\, are capable of connecting directly to the Internet. To avoid devices “poking a hole” in your private smart home\, you can build your own devices\, using open source examples. This talk will demonstrate the ease of building not only the WebThings Gateway with private voice control\, but also devices you can manage. You can manage devices you build\, and those you buy\, using the Gateway. Easy examples of devices you can build will also be demonstrated\, including motion\, temperature\, and door/window sensors\, relays to control powered devices\, and pushbuttons and dimmer switches.On-line tutorial to build your own gateway:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yR0UcwdvmhzFIOGS-9enoeSiKqHAFlGZY7AkYmiMcXo/edit#heading=h.1y4m2zfpf52f

SUMMARY:The New Shiny System Call in the Block - Abhijit Singh\, Uber
DESCRIPTION:With the release of Linux 5.1\, a new IO interface\, io_uring\, was added for asynchronous IO\, which is supposed to change the basic mechanics of many IO heavy systems.The talk will commence by highlighting the need for a new IO interface\, which is to provide a true async file IO interface even for buffered accesses. The talk will focus on the design of the interface for interaction and how it is different that the existing read/write\, aio interfaces. The talk will describe the core ring based data structures\, which are completion and submission queue.The kernel is the consumer of submission queue entries and the application will be the producer of them. The roles will reverse for completion queue which is quite expected. It will also be pointed out that how this is similar to network IO interfaces between the NIC and the kernel and that might have an inspiration to do things similarly for File IO. One of the key things which will pointed is that\, this architecture leads to fewer system calls and consequently less context switches.The final section will talk about liburing and examples which makes using io_uring easier for applications and how apps are preparing to use it.

SUMMARY:Open Source - Killing Standards Organizations or Saving Them - Charles Eckel\, Cisco Systems
DESCRIPTION:Open source communities move quickly\, value running code\, and docs are best effort at best. Standards move slowly\, value precise specs\, and negotiate compromises for broad alignment. Given these differences\, why would open source communities fraternize with standards orgs? Standards orgs such as IETF and MEF realize they need to change to remain relevant. By embracing open source\, standards orgs benefit from the speed and collaborative spirit of open source and get timely feedback on the clarity and correctness of standards as they evolve in parallel with running code. Open source communities gain users\, address additional use cases\, and gain the stability of standards to ease integration efforts and avoid forks. This session explores this evolution in standards orgs\, highlights areas of mutual interest\, and shares ideas on the benefit of closer collaboration.

SUMMARY:Quality is Everyone's Responsibility - Brahadambal Srinivasan\, IBM
DESCRIPTION:Open Source communities typically focus on core functionality rather than aspects like performance and quality. The standard process followed across communities is such that the open source code is adopted and commercialized by different vendors and each vendor takes it through their downstream integration\, system and performance tests.While the development community feels a sense of pride contributing towards open source\, the test community feels a little left out as most open source projects relies on automated functional tests; and the current level of testing by the community falls short of what is needed for a platform or enterprise-ready product. Consequently\, each of the vendors or distributors has to put in parallel and often overlapping efforts to validate different architectures or configurations.Quality of open source projects can be significantly improved if a better path is set for quality and test engineers to contribute. This is a call-to-action and proposed here are a few changes that the open source community can take to engage test engineers better and leverage from their expertise.

DESCRIPTION:Encouraging other people to participate in your company’s open source project is not an easy task\, and there is no one size fits all solution. However\, there are some things that you can do to increase your chances of success.This talk contains 3 parts\, and here are a few examples of what will be covered in each section:1) Openness and Transparency: Use public channels for all project communications\, and include decision-making processes and leadership in your governance documents. Be honest with yourselves and the community about governance and contributions.2) Growth: Remove barriers to contribution and consider how legal decisions will impact participation. Be proactive\, but leave space for outside contributors.3) Corporate Factors: Provide training for engineers and product managers in how to work and plan features in the open. Recruit customers and partners as contributors.The audience will walk away with practical advice about encouraging outside participation in corporate open source projects.A short (20 min) version of this talk was presented at FOSDEM in Brussels\, so this will be a significantly expanded version with double the amount of content.

SUMMARY:Democratizing AI with Sparklyr - Javier Luraschi\, RStudio
DESCRIPTION:Artificial Intelligence is a rapid-growing field with significant transformational impact to many industries and civilization at large; however\, using AI in 2020 is still hard and requires highly-qualified teams to set up the infrastructure and successfully apply AI techniques.The new 'sparklyr' project simplifies the process of scaling AI by providing an interface for scalable computing\, machine learning\, and deep learning using technologies like R\, Apache Spark\, MLlib\, MLeap\, Apache Livy\, Apache Arrow\, and so on.This talk will present 'sparklyr' as a modern\, easy to use\, and capable interface to prototype\, implement\, and scale AI workflows into automated and production-ready pipelines. The secret-sauce for 'sparklyr' is to provide first-class support for local-development\, which is key while prototyping AI workflows\, interoperate with relevant AI frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras\, and enable scaling out local workflows into proper cluster-computing environments using Apache Spark.This talk will also present future directions and opportunities for Open Source contributors to join this exciting project and helps us make AI accessible to everyone.

SUMMARY:The Common Configuration Scoring System for Kubernetes Security - Julien Sobrier\, Octarine Labs Inc.
DESCRIPTION:The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is widely used to score vulnerabilities found in docker images. But how do you score the risk level of an entire workload\, with its runtime configurations\, network configurations\, Pod Security Policy\, privileges and capabilities added\, etc.?Julien will explore the Kubernetes Common Configuration Scoring System (KCCSS)\, an open-source framework to calculate risk scores for Kubernetes workloads\, and kube-scan\, an open-source scanner that implements the KCCSS. Based on CVSS\, it categorizes risks associated with each runtime setting while considering how settings affect one another\, and offers a global risk score for each workload—not just for individual settings. Attendees will learn how the KCCSS works\, how it’s being used by end users for DevSecOps\, and best practices for bullet proofing their own K8s applications.

SUMMARY:Dynamic Policy Enforcement for Microservice Environments - Ash Narkar\, Styra Inc
DESCRIPTION:How do you control “who can do what” across the stack? How do you enforce authorization\, admission control\, and risk management policies in your microservices\, orchestrators\, and CI/CD systems? How do you implement low-latency policy enforcement in the polyglot environments that your company depends on?The only sustainable\, scalable way to enforce or even monitor security\, compliance\, and operational policies requires that those policies be taken out of PDFs\, emails\, wikis and hardcoded software and be written in a domain-agnostic programming language.In this talk\, Ash will introduce the Open Policy Agent (OPA)\, an open source\, general-purpose policy engine used by companies like Netflix\, Intuit\, and CapitalOne to enforce policies across a breadth of domains such as custom applications\, container-management\, i.e. Kubernetes\, public clouds\, server management etc.Ash will focus on the design of an OPA-driven application development process that results in the creation of secure microservices that are injected with a OPA sidecar\, thereby empowering security teams to define custom security policies using OPA.

SUMMARY:Diversity & Inclusion Badging Program - Matt Germonprez & Matt Snell\, University of Nebraska at Omaha
DESCRIPTION:The proposed session aims to increase understanding of the open source project and event practices that encourage greater diversity and wider inclusion of people from different backgrounds. Diversity in open source is opaque to participants\, newcomers\, and stakeholders because contributors are distributed\, and in many cases are an agglomeration of individuals in different locations.The goal of a Diversity & Inclusion Badging Program is to encourage projects and events to obtain D&I badges for reasons of pride\, leadership\, self-reflection\, and self-improvement on issues critical to building the Internet as a social good. This includes: (1) establishing an environment where projects and events can engage in the badging program\, (2) aligning the badging program with best practices\, guidelines and recommendations from D&I efforts on the CHAOSS project\, (3) connecting with existing badging standards creating badge classes (e.g.\, gold\, silver\, and bronze)\, and (4) Building an open\, peer-review system for the D&I Badging Program.

SUMMARY:Apps Are the New Edge and Are Everywhere: Mobile\, Edge and Cloud - Sree Lakshmi Sarva\, NetFoundry Inc.
DESCRIPTION:In this session we’ll learn how to embed zero trust network connectivity into mobile\, cloud or IoT edge applications with end to end encryption\, leverage HW root of trust\, integrate with leading identity\, authentication and authorization services\, providing compartmentalized micro-segmented access without any additional overhead or management of infrastructure..Networking in the Internet of Things (IoT) world has proven to be difficult. It is slow and expensive to work with telecom carriers to deploy custom hardware\, circuits\, and VPNs. Not to mention SD-WAN and VPN architectures weren't designed for the IoT application topology. Project Ziti now available on GitHub is an open source platform enabling modern\, programmable zero trust\, network overlay and associated edge componentry for application-embedded networking. Zero trust refers to an evolving set of network security paradigms that narrows defenses from wide network perimeters to individual resources\, supporting remote endpoints and cloud-based assets not located within an enterprise-owned network boundary (as defined by NIST 800-207 and the related Cloud Security Alliance SDPv2).

SUMMARY:Sandboxing in Linux with Zero Lines of Code - Ignat Korchagin\, Cloudflare
DESCRIPTION:Linux seccomp is a simple\, yet powerful tool to sandbox running processes and significantly decrease potential damage in case the application code gets exploited. It provides fine-grained controls for the process to declare what it can and can’t do in advance and in most cases has zero performance overhead.The only disadvantage - to utilise this framework\, application developers have to explicitly add sandboxing code to their projects and developers usually either delay this or omit completely as their main focus is mostly on the functionality of the code rather than security. Moreover\, seccomp security model is based around system calls\, but many developers\, writing their code in high-level programming languages and frameworks\, either have little knowledge to no experience with syscalls or just don’t have easy to use seccomp abstractions or libraries for their frameworks.All this makes seccomp not that widely adopted\, but what if there was a way to easily sandbox any application in any programming language without writing a single line of code? This presentation discusses potential approaches and their pros and cons.

SUMMARY:The Most Lightweight Virtual Machine Monitor Is No Monitor at All - Ricardo Koller\, IBM Research
DESCRIPTION:Container runtimes have been using virtualization as a way of improving isolation (e.g.\, Kata containers). And in order to make them feel like regular containers\, the community has been trying to slim down their virtual machine (VM) monitors (e.g.\, Firecracker). In this talk we describe what happens when you slim down to the extreme: no monitor at all.We implemented a Linux virtual machine that runs as a single unprivileged user-level process on top of only 11 syscalls. We achieve isolation equivalent to virtual machines\, without using a monitor\, by restricting the VM process to only these 11 system calls using seccomp (on already open file descriptors). The system was built on top of a combination of two well known Linux features: user mode linux (UML) and no-MMU support (used for embedded devices) both in the kernel and in userspace (musl and busybox).Our initial experiments show that this Linux VM is capable of running multiple unmodified binaries from Alpine (like python\, nginx\, redis)\, and can boot in 6 milliseconds (to our knowledge\, this is the fastest); albeit with some limitations: PIE executables only\, and no forks (processes are emulated using vforks).

SUMMARY:Why Is There No Free Software Vulnerability Database? - Philippe Ombredanne\, AboutCode.org and nexB Inc. & Michael Herzog\, nexB Inc.
DESCRIPTION:Something is not right: comprehensive databases of known FOSS software vulnerabilities are mostly proprietary and privately maintainer. Why could not these be open data instead? They are after all about FOSS code."Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities" is one of the OWASP Top 10 Most Critical Web Application Security Risks. Identifying such vulnerable components is currently hindered by data structure and tools that are (1) designed primarily for proprietary software components and (2) incomplete and too dependent on voluntary submissions to the National Vulnerability Database. With the explosion of FOSS usage over the last decade we need a new approach to efficiently identify FOSS security vulnerabilities. And that approach should be based on open data and FOSS tools.Find how we are working to build new FOSS tools to aggregate\, relate together and curate software component vulnerability data from multiple sources and automate the search for FOSS component security vulnerabilities.The benefit: improved security of software applications with open tools and data for everyone.

SUMMARY:Growing Sustainable Contributions Through Ambassador Networks - Alison Yu\, Indeed & Shilla Saebi\, Comcast
DESCRIPTION:Comcast and Indeed are committed to fostering open source contributions to the external projects that we depend on. One type of program that both companies use is an Open Source Ambassador Program to help new and experienced individuals contribute to open source projects that they use.During this talk we’ll go over what an ambassador program is\, how we decided to use them in our organizations\, the path to buy-in and budget approval\, how they were implemented\, results we saw\, and lessons learned. We’ll present specific case studies of how our Ambassador Programs helped with specific campaigns and how that fosters open source sustainability.At Indeed we’ll compare results from Hacktoberfest in 2018 and 2019\, and the results that we saw before and after implementing the Open Source Ambassador Program.At Comcast\, the Open Source Ambassador working group was formed in 2018 where ambassadors focus on Open Source practices\, raising awareness\, compliance and strategy. The aim of the OSAP is to foster discussion across the various Comcast tech offices and understand Open Source needs and issues across the organization.

DESCRIPTION:Linux has an incredible selection of tools for both debugging and profiling applications to get the most out of the system. In this session\, we will start with gdb and show many of the lesser-known features that can significantly shorten debugging time. Next we will focus on the profiling and code coverage features found in gprof/gcov for determining both the performance of function calls and whether your test code is actually testing all of the code that it needs to test via examining the code coverage of the execution. Next\, we will go into more sophisticated approaches using strace\, ftrace\, oprofile and LTTng and show how they work and why you might choose one over the other for certain tasks.

SUMMARY:Inside the Linux Security Modules (LSM) - Vandana Salve\, Prasme Systems
DESCRIPTION:Many of the features for securing Linux are built either in to the Linux kernel or added by the various Linux Distribution. The Linux security Module (LSM) framework provides a mechanism for the various security checks to be hooked by the new kernel.The LSM functionality is compiled directly into the Linux kernel using the LSM framework.The most prevalent users of LSM interface are the Mandatory access control which provides comprehensive security policy. The existing examples are SELinux\, Smack\, Tomoya and AppArmor. Along with the larger set of MAC extensions\, other extensions can be built using the LSM framework to provide specific changes to the system operations when these tweaks are not available in the core functionality of the Linux kernel.The Linux security module (LSM) framework provides a mechanism for the various security checks to be hooked at the various kernel subsystem. The security is attained by the LSM framework by enforcing the access policies on the system resources.The presentation will dive deep into the LSM framework\, the different hooks supported by the existing LSM modules and how to implement new LSM module for the required functionality.

SUMMARY:Toolchains in the New Era and How to Update Safely - Victor Rodriguez\, Intel
DESCRIPTION:GNU toolchains have been on the community for more than 3 decades. They provide new features every year. However\, despite the fact that new technology is released every year (GLIBC twice a year) Linux developers barely use this technology for multiple reasons: the complexity of recompiling the distribution\, build and runtime problems of some packages. The question then is not only what new technology is being implemented on new toolchain releases\, but how to consume on a stable development system?. This presentation aims to show the best-known methods to use the latest version of the toolchains in your operating system\, as well as the incoming new toolchain features for 2020. This year the toolchain release features such as pthread_clockjoin_np (for enabling join with a terminated thread with a specific clock)\, support in Binutils for debuginfod\, inter-procedural optimization improvements and link-time optimization improvements. Having a better understanding of the toolchains allows showcasing the best of CPU architecture technology\, from low-level kernel features to complex applications which span the entire operating system

SUMMARY:Lessons Learned in Creating Edge Management with Open Source Software - Jim White\, IOTech Systems
DESCRIPTION:While the development of edge and IoT applications is advancing\, one of the challenges organizations are facing is how to get their applications to the edge while also monitoring and managing them. How do you get the bits to the box? There are some proprietary solutions and many have attempted to use cloud native deployment tools (like Kubernetes) with mixed results. There is also a plethora of open source tools to assist deploy\, orchestrate\, manage and monitor applications. In this presentation\, come learn about an effort to stitch together a collection of open source tools and technologies to create an edge management solution. What worked and what did not? What tools can scale to IoT sizes but at the same time work in resource constrained edge environments? Why proprietary solutions may or may not work for managing your edge/IoT deployments.In this session\, learn• What does edge management do?• What are the requirements of edge management?• How does edge management differ from managing cloud\, enterprise\, mobile or the company laptops?• The current state of the art• Elements of an open edge management solution• What does edge scale mean?

SUMMARY:CIP Installed: Sustainable Software Stacks in Long-living Products - Urs Gleim\, Siemens AG & Yoshitake Kobayashi\, Toshiba Corporation
DESCRIPTION:Since the Civil Infrastructure Platform project launched in April 2016\, we work with other open source communities to develop a super long-term supported (SLTS) open source "base layer" of industrial grade software that enables the implementation of building blocks in civil infrastructure projects. Long-term sustainability becomes a more major issue for not only industrial IoT systems\, such as power plants\, traffic lights\, communications and weather systems\, but also consumer IoT systems such as automotive and smart homes. In this talk\, we will show the latest results of the CIP community in first half. Then we move to introduce examples of how CIP is used in real-world use cases.

SUMMARY:Test Driven Development in Open Source Projects - Jonathan Berkhahn\, IBM
DESCRIPTION:The scalability of best practices in large open source projects is a major cause for concern. Test driven development or similar processes are often regarded as nice to have but not required. This session will cover how TDD can be used as a tool to better enable sustainability of development by distributed teams and people. We will use TDD to stand up a basic Golang application\, and step through increasing levels of complexity to show how these tests ensure the continued functionality of our project. Finally\, we'll compare the process we've stepped through with how tests are written in Kubernetes to show how the process can scale to real-world open source projects.

SUMMARY:How to Grow Your Open Source Project and Become an Umbrella Project - John Mertic\, The Linux Foundation
DESCRIPTION:Since its launch in 2015\, Open Mainframe Project has slowly gained technical momentum and grown the ecosystem. With more than 30 partners and members\, 2019 was a turning point for the project. We doubled the number of projects that are hosted and became more of an umbrella much like CNCF\, LF Edge and Hyperledger. This is an extraordinary accomplishment\, which speaks to the commitment that companies of all sizes have made to be good partners in the OMP community.In this session\, John Mertic will outline growing pains and strategies that have helped OMP break apart from the pack and become an umbrella with nine different but complementary open source projects underneath it. OMP has a technical infrastructure that lets contributors share responsibility for the project\, which ensures that the people contributors trust with decision making are in-fact granted ownership over that decision making and also that responsibilities are distributed rather than centralized whenever possible. John will also discuss some of the new OMP projects and how to jump start their TSC and contributors.

SUMMARY:Ensuring That Documentation Is a First-class Citizen in Open Source Projects - Ray Paik\, GitLab & Sofia Wallin\, Ericsson Software Technology
DESCRIPTION:We often see many open source projects struggle with maintaining quality documentation and finding contributors who are interested in helping with project documentation. There are a number of reasons for this\, such as many viewing documentation as a separate product from code\, or even a belief that people should be able to make sense of what the code is doing by reading the code itself.For these and other reasons\, documentation work is often done at the last minute\, and done by people with low motivation and minimum effort. So the quality of the output will naturally suffer. These issues can be addressed by making sure that documentation is everyone’s responsibility and that documentation is a core part of the product and is created using the same development and community processes.In this session\, Sofia will share her learnings as a documentation project lead in OPNFV and ONAP\, and how their best practice is used throughout Linux Foundation Networking. Ray will discuss how community contributions are managed for GitLab documentation\, and how community members are able to apply their experience from documentation work to future contributions to other areas of GitLab.

SUMMARY:A Path Towards Open Source Contributions - Brian Douglas\, GitHub
DESCRIPTION:Today Open Source is ubiquitous and comprises nearly 80% – 90% of the code in a “typical” application. Based on GitHub’s 2019 Octoverse\, the average project is built on ~180 open source packages of dependencies.There is a need to leverage open-source to stay competitive\, and the benefit of open source is the ability for developers to contribute and work where they are. There is also a need for open-source sustainability with contributions technically and financially.Knowing the clear need for open source to support projects in the community\, where do we start?Join me in this talk on how I leveraged my employee resource groups to engage existing underserved developer communities with direct mentorship —focused on growing meaningful contributions.

SUMMARY:Intelligent Open Source - Daniel Izquierdo\, Bitergia & Jim Jagielski\, Uber
DESCRIPTION:Uber has been contributing and producing open source since its inception. During the last years\, it has started its own Open Source Program Office with the aim of better contributing to the open source world and becoming a good open source citizen.However\, what makes a good open source citizen and how do we interpret the health of our open source activities? These are the questions that Uber and Bitergia have tried to answer together through the analysis of the several aspects of the Uber open source ecosystem.By this ecosystem\, this means Uber developers working in third party open source projects\, and at the same time\, external developers contributing to currently lead or previously donated open source projects.For this\, four main areas of analysis have been identified as key for the health of Uber open source activities:1- Engagement: as in Uber developers engaged in third party open source projects\, and as in external open source developers engaged in Uber projects.2- Collaboration with other organizations in the open source ecosystem.3- Health of projects that matter to Uber4- Software development performance\, and recognition and celebration of contributions

SUMMARY:Hack the Project Onboarding Process: Learning by Writing Tutorials as a New Contributor - Emily Shaffer\, Google
DESCRIPTION:It’s common for projects\, especially open source projects\, to have poor onboarding documentation for new developers\, even if other reference documentation is good. This can present a barrier to entry for those interested in contributing to an open project. The talk will discuss strategies for new contributors around writing tutorial documentation which did not previously exist as a method of onboarding. By contributing developer-oriented tutorials early on (the “explain to a novice” method of learning)\, new contributors can learn about the project at a deep level. The tutorials they create will then speed the onboarding of even more new contributors later on\, improving the documentation health of the project and smoothing the learning curve. Inspired by the author’s experience bootstrapping as a developer on the Git project; the talk will include examples and tips for contributors interested in learning for themselves by writing new documentation for any project.

SUMMARY:Lightning Talk: Building an Inclusive and Diverse Corporate Culture - Riya Bansal\, InterviewBit
DESCRIPTION:​Being a woman on a team of all men means that you are going to have a unique voice and it’s very important to embrace it. It could also mean being the only one to speak against the popular opinion\, or becoming more visible to get the same level of recognition.​While study after study demonstrates diversity drives major business benefits\, the truth is most of us would rather not talk about the issues that force us to have diversity strategies in the first place. Or at least not talk directly with those we want to influence. Instead\, we talk “amongst ourselves\,” with those who can sympathize with our situation\, rather than being brave enough to have the conversations that matter most.There are no shortcuts for enabling inclusive workplaces. The key is ​not to let fear hold you back from full engagement. But you need to start somewhere. In this short talk\, we’ll discuss how to launch team conversations\, holding all-hands meetings calling out racially charged incidents when they happen or introducing yourself with your pronouns. The conversation you’re avoiding is the very one needed to address the deep\, systemic issues of inequality in the workplace. This talk will also help the audience to realize how they can create a diverse and inclusive environment by following some very basic and easy things in their daily routine.

SUMMARY:BoF: Discussing Metrics for Open Source in Light of Insights From the CHAOSS Project - Georg Link\, Bitergia
DESCRIPTION:Open source communities have grown beyond what we can comprehend without tool support. The complexity is still on the rise including cross-community collaboration of dependent projects. We can use metrics for observing community health. This comes with challenges including a choice for what to measure and where to get the data.The birds of a feather session will begin by addressing the challenges with insights from the Linux Foundation CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics Open Source Software) project\, which is at the forefront of establishing best practices for community metrics. These insights include: establishing a baseline against which to measure community changes\, building a metrics strategy for a community\, observing cross-community collaboration when contributors work across open source projects\, and tools available to begin the metrics journey.After sharing these insights\, the second part of the session will be an open dialog about experiences\, concerns\, and specific use cases that participants bring forward. For a large group\, we will split into smaller discussion groups and share highlights at the end.

SUMMARY:Lightning Talk: How to See Your Own Perception Bias - Aeva Black\, Azure Confidential Computing
DESCRIPTION:Five years ago\, I was running one of OpenStack's hottest projects and my career was skyrocketting upwards\, but that changed when I brought my gender expression inline with my gender identity. As a result of transitioning\, I experienced a shift in bias that no one could have prepared me for -- but it's not what you're thinking.In the two years that followed\, I received over 30 rejections for roles and levels that I had previously held. I anticipated that I would run into stereotypes and negative bias\, but the most surprising change in bias was internal.Years of practicing meditation gave me a direct awareness that our perceptions are coloured by our past experiences\, but as this body's hormones changed\, so too did my own perception of the world!The interplay between memory and sensation\, which occurs continually in each of us\, is known as "perception bias"\, and I have some news for you: we're all biased -- and that's OK.What matters is what we do with it.

DESCRIPTION:The CHAOSS community develops metrics\, methodologies\, and software for expressing open source project health and sustainability. By measuring open source project health and sustainability\, CHAOSS seeks to improve the transparency of open source project health and sustainability so that relevant stakeholders can make more informed decisions about open source project engagement.Questions evolve\, and specialized open source software communities that emerge around mergers and acquisitions find dashboards insufficient for understanding community health and sustainability. Specifically\, will have an open discussion to discuss examples of how companies apply CHAOSS project metrics using software from the CHAOSS project\, Augur. Using a standardized data structure has already enable dozens of companies to answer questions using CHAOSS metricsOur discussion goals are to (1) sustain the communal\, technical\, and data core of the CHAOSS project by identifying emergent questions about open source project health (e.g.\, diversity & inclusion; evolution; value; risk) and (2) scale and develop deeper connections between organizations and institutions who participate.

SUMMARY:How to Keep Up with Open Source Innovation? - Alejandro del Castillo\, National Instruments
DESCRIPTION:The Open Source ecosystem is gigantic and constantly growing. If Open Source projects of interest are identified at the right time during the development process\, there is an opportunity to leverage the OSS project on a product/project. This reduces waste by avoiding reinventing the wheel\, and also consolidates collaboration in common infrastructure that anyone can use.However\, identifying Open Source projects that can provide leverage to existing projects & products is a very challenging endeavor. Organizations tend to rely on individual motivation and knowledge\, which is suboptimal. At National Instruments\, the Open Source Guild was created to serve as a technology funnel for the rest of the organization. The Guild members are Open Source enthusiasts that dive into projects of interests to learn its capabilities and leverage potential\, to then radiate the knowledge to the rest of the organizations. Discussion will include:- Using Open Source Foundations as filters- Tracking Open Source consideration and/or adoption- Overcoming skepticism- Success stories- Challenges

SUMMARY:Tutorial: Device Tree (DTS)\, Linux Board Bring-up and Kernel Version Changing - A Review of Some Lessons Learned - Schuyler Patton\, Texas Instruments
DESCRIPTION:This session is targeted for those who are bringing up Linux on a board based on an existing board supported in the Linux source tree and fairly new to Linux. To make a better “initial” board bring-up experience a functionally minimal Device Tree Source (DTS) approach will be discussed from which a board developer can take the initial DTS to full board functionality.The session will first look at how examining the existing board’s DTS file for how it is constructed and what to look for in terms of what is processor specific and what is board specific and why that matters.Next a method will be discussed on testing a new board DTS file on the existing reference board while waiting for the new board. Overall this method can be described as a “Hello World” type minimal DTS for a board which can be used for board bring up and kernel version upgrades. To close out the session will be a discussion on preparing for kernel upgrades as sometimes projects take years to complete.While it will not be possible to future proof a board there will be some pointers as a summary that highlight why topics presented earlier in the session that are useful as well during a kernel version upgrade.

SUMMARY:A Disciplined Approach to Debugging - Lev Iserovich\, D. E. Shaw Research
DESCRIPTION:A large fraction of the time spent on software development and system design projects is used for debugging. However\, effective debugging techniques are not as well-studied or formalized as those for writing code. Instead\, debugging is typically tackled with ad-hoc and idiosyncratic approaches. This talk will present a systematic approach to debugging software and hardware in order to locate bugs more effectively. It will also describe a taxonomy to classify such “insects\,” which should enable better code-writing practices.Debugging faulty hardware\, single executables\, multi-threaded programs\, and distributed applications will be covered. Tips and tricks for software and hardware debugging using tools like GDB\, Wireshark\, gperftools\, and hardware protocol analyzers will also be presented\, along with examples of both common and unusual bugs caught in the wild.

SUMMARY:Secure Boot and Over-the-Air Updates - That's Simple\, No? - Jan Kiszka\, Siemens AG
DESCRIPTION:Locking down embedded Linux devices via secure boot is almost solved these day. Combining this with rollback-capable over-the-air updates shouldn't be hard then. But as often\, the devil is in the detail. When he comes out\, you can easily end up with an insecure system or one that does not update anymore. Or both.In this talk\, we will present patterns and tools for secure OTA system updates that are being developed in the Software Update Workgroup of the Civil Infrastructure Platform project. We will introduce an OTA pattern consisting of redundant update images that are deployed and managed by SWUpdate and switched by a boot loader. We will discuss the options and implication of securing those images\, for the boot process as well as the runtime of the images. Then we will walk through UEFI-based secure boot processes\, explain shortcomings of commodity boot loaders are and where to use the embedded boot loader EFI Boot Guard instead. Finally\, we will also have a look at plain U-Boot-based setups\, discuss if its new UEFI mode can help to unify architectures and explain what to do when it is not available.

SUMMARY:Tutorial: Introduction to I2C and SPI: Both In-kernel and In-userspace - Michael Welling\, QWERTY Embedded Design\, LLC
DESCRIPTION:I2C was initially invented by Philips as a simple 2-wire low-speed communications interface between CPUs and simple peripherals. Used primarily in embedded systems to connect things like I/O devices\, it is now used\, under various names\, by most IC manufacturers on many System-on-chips. This seminar will introduce I2C and the I2Cdev API which allows you to write I2C drivers from userspace in Linux.The SPI\, or Serial Peripheral Interface is a protocol developed by Motorola which has become a defacto standard for short distance communication between CPU and peripherals. Although it can be called by several different names\, it is a very common bus on embedded devices. This seminar will introduce SPI generally and SPIdev which is a Linux userspace API to write simple SPI drivers without having to write kernel code.

SUMMARY:Tutorial: How to Ansible\, a Tutorial - John Hawley\, VMware
DESCRIPTION:Gone are the days when an administrator could\, realistically\, count the number of machines they were responsible for\, and the days of very large scale deployments are here. This also means gone are the days when an admin could reasonably log into all of those machines to do the configuration by hand. Today it's best to rely on an automation framework to do this on a larger\, more replicable\, scale. Ansible is one such automation framework and this is a intended to walk folks through the very basics of Ansible\, getting it set up\, up and running\, passing data\, fetching information and generally getting comfortable with the basics of what configuration management is. This is a hands-on tutorial with specific walkthroughs by using virtual machines provided for the tutorial (a laptop sufficiently capable of running two virtual machines would be required).

SUMMARY:Exploring the New Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) Interactive Landscape - Tracy Ragan\, DeployHub\, Inc.
DESCRIPTION:The push towards a modern architecture running Kubernetes\, containers and microservices is disrupting continuous integration and delivery as we know it. And its about time. This session will cover what changes will be required for building out a new K8s Pipeline that will support hundreds of workflows supporting thousands of deployments daily. We will discuss what is new in the pipeline and what will eventually go away to support a shift from monolithic continuous delivery to a service-based continuous delivery. 4 main pipeline challenges will be reviewed:• Shifting from monolithic application releases to independently deployable services;• Tracking microservices to the logical view of an application;• Finding and sharing reusable microservices;• Tracking microservice versions and configurations.Because existing pipelines will need to be tweaked to fit into a microservice model\, this session will break down the different tooling required by reviewing the new Continuous Delivery Foundation Interactive Landscape as a source of information for moving forward into this new territory.

SUMMARY:How Many Ways Can You Fail? A Taxonomy of Corporate (in)Decision - Federico Lucifredi\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:Decision-making in the modern corporation is riddled with paradox: the outward declared objective of the organization\, has to contend with all too human realities ranging from the Peter Principle to having too many cooks in the kitchen\, to the individual's perfectionism\, indecision\, or even straight up cowardice. Decisions that are the lifeblood of your project can be deferred\, avoided\, or derailed in perfectly legitimate and even well-meaning ways. This can spell death for what you were tasked to build\, as success depends on implementation as much as on a good idea. You cannot execute if decisions are not prompt\, mostly correct\, and accepted by the team.We dissect how decisions do *not* happen\, and what you can do about it. Success in business depends on getting things done. Join us as we explore the lost art of thinking in the corporation\, and what you as a tiny but revolutionary-minded cog can do about it.

SUMMARY:Kernel Coding the Upstream Way - Tim Bird\, Sony
DESCRIPTION:The Linux kernel has a number of unwritten idioms and design patterns that are used for optimal development and code efficiency. This talk seeks to illustrate these coding patterns\, and help developers implement Linux kernel code in the "upstream way".Tim will describe some of the kernel idioms for error handling\, use of gotos\, structures with embedded data and links\, use of function pointers\, when to use ifdefs\, inlines and macros\, structure initialization\, and more. Each pattern will be explained\, with examples\, and the rationale for each pattern will be provided.The purpose is to allow a developer to write code that is not only efficient\, making best use of kernel interfaces\, but also to make the code easier to maintain and easier to be contribute upstream\, with less correction required for acceptance into mainline.

SUMMARY:Tutorial: Using Linux Primitives to Build Your Own Containers - Stephane Graber & Christian Brauner\, Canonical Ltd.
DESCRIPTION:Most people are familiar with various container tools including Docker\, LXC and LXD. But they rarely are familiar with the kernel features enabling those tools.To better understand everything involved\, we will be creating our own container\, from scratch.Starting to look at the various namespaces\, what they do\, how to use them together\, then setting up a suitable filesystem\, integrating with a LSM\, do some privilege and capability dropping and putting restrictions in place with cgroups.At every step\, you will see what your container can do and what it probably shouldn't be allowed to do\, through this experience you will get a better understanding of all the moving pieces that are put together to create a container.

SUMMARY:QM Qualification of Open Source Software - John MacGregor\, Robert Bosch GmbH
DESCRIPTION:Under prevailing safety practices\, software components should be “qualified” to be used in safety-critical automotive systems.In automotive terminology\, an organisation developing automotive systems has a quality management (QM) system. The parts of the system that are not subject to the more stringent safety-related (ASIL) requirements are developed according to the organisation’s normal (QM) practices and are called “QM” software.Until now\, safety standards have implicitly assumed that organisations that develop components have an "industrial-grade" QM system. The development and quality management processes employed in open source development diverge considerably from those envisaged by ISO 26262\, the automotive domain standard. Qualification is far from guaranteed.In other words\, open source components must meet the minimum requirements of “industrial” software integrity in order to be integrated into safety-critical automotive systems.This presentation examines the requirements that ISO 26262 imposes on QM software and presents approaches to qualify open source components as QM and integrate them in safety-critical automotive applications.

SUMMARY:Learning Python Through Open Source - Tyler Mestery\, East Ridge High School
DESCRIPTION:Learning python on a normal laptop is boring. What about trying to learn it on a Raspberry Pi 4\, and using only Open Source tools? Tyler will show you how you can do exactly this; learn Python with Open Source tools on a Raspberry Pi 4. Here are some more questions that are going to be answered in his talk: How well does it work putting your work on Github? Is it a learning experience to learn on the Pi? How well does it help a non-python programmer learn Python? What are some advantages/disadvantages while using the Pi? Was it very efficient? What are some of the key commands that he learned how to use in Python?Throughout Tyler’s talk he is going to address how well learning Python using only Open Source tools worked. While Tyler is learning along the way he will be saving files of key learning points to Github. Then everyone can access these and use them to teach themselves more about Python. Tyler will also be making tutorials along the way in his presentation. Tyler will be showing some of the tools he used live in his presentation so you can see how easy it is to use Open Source software to learn Python.

SUMMARY:Software in Space - What Can Everyday Developers and Managers Learn from Space Missions? - Joseph Winchester\, IBM
DESCRIPTION:This talk covers how software is used in space missions focusing on the four most high profile failures\, and mission rescues. Ariane 5\, Cassini Huygens\, Mars Polar Lander\, and Spirit Rover. These were all struck down by lack of testing\, software not being switched off when it was no longer required\, failure to understand metric and imperial conversion\, and race conditions writing to memory. While these had catastrophic results in two of these\, the other two were rescued through a combination of brute force\, raw ingenuity\, and brilliant innovation. This talks will cover each of the space missions and discuss how the lessons learnt can and should be applied to day to day programing and testing and architecture of all software packages\, especially as shops rush to move to adopt agile results without fully understanding the risks.This talk is of value to developers\, managers\, testers\, technical writers\, and everyone who has worked on or around a software project\, and through storytelling and examples it tries to make the audience think about mistakes they have made\, short cuts they are making\, and to create better software for the world we live in as well as beyond

SUMMARY:Migrating AWS Lambda Functions to Open Source Serverless on OpenFaaS - Burton Rheutan\, OpenFaaS
DESCRIPTION:Serverless helps teams ship code without concern for underlying infrastructure. The market leader is AWS Lambda\, however it is neither open source\, nor does it allow for portability between clouds\, which poses a problem for many corporations. What happens when you need a function to run longer than the allotted time\, use more than the maximum memory limit\, or continue to utilize an older\, or newer\, version of the language\, or even a different language altogether?In this talk we’ll migrate an existing AWS Lambda function with storage to Kubernetes with OpenFaaS using open source alternatives in order to continue supporting the existing language version\, or to avoiding a major refactor to keep within the limits set by AWS.In the end\, you will have your serverless functions in your control where you will be able to set your own limits\, support any number of languages and versions\, as well as being able to view and contribute to the code base. This also means that you will be able to run and manage your serverless functions in your own datacenter without having to operate in the public cloud. Keep your functions secure in your private network\, behind your corporate firewalls.

SUMMARY:Ideas for Finer-grained Control over your Heat Budget - Amit Kucheria & Daniel Lezcano\, Linaro
DESCRIPTION:Due to the increasing complexity of SoC\, we're now seeing lots of thermal sensors on the die to quickly detect hot spots and allow the OS to take steps to mitigate these events - either through better scheduling\, frequency throttling\, idle injection or other similar techniques.The Linux thermal framework has a 1:1 mapping between a thermal sensor\, thermal zone and governor that make it very hard to have a layered policy to reflect different policy decisions at a SoC-\, Cluster-\, CPU- and GPU-levels.We're currently experimenting with a hierarchical arrangement of these sensors and their associated governors to better account for heat contribution of each thermal zone to the overall thermal budget of the device and thereby allow different policies at various levels of the SoC hierarchy.Attendees are expected to know a little bit about how the current thermal framework works\, but don't need to know all the technical details. We will cover the conceptual differences between the current and proposed models as an introduction in the talk.

SUMMARY:Safeguards in the Stable Kernel Process - Sasha Levin\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:There is a common misconception that while Linus's tree is heavily tested and validated\, the Stable and LTS trees aren't reviewed or tested at all. This talk aims to change this misconception.In reality\, Stable trees are not only heavily tested\, but the testing they are being subjected to is much more similar to "real world" workloads that the kernel will have to endure once it's released.We will go over every step a patch goes from the point it's sent to the mailing list\, to after it was included in a stable tree\, highlighting the process which makes it very difficult to introduce bugs into the Stable trees.

SUMMARY:Security Minded Development - Shuah Khan\, The Linux Foundation
DESCRIPTION:We all care about keeping our data safe and systems secure. We counter security attacks using fuzzers and other test tools toidentify vulnerabilities and hardening the code base.How can we ensure we aren't introducing new problems? Regression testing and continuous fuzzing helps in finding regressions and new problems as code evolves and new features get addedAll of these efforts are focused on finding and fixing existing problems.Could we do more in understanding common design and coding mistakes to avoid and/or minimize introducing vulnerabilitiesThis talk explores best practices and keeping an eye out for ways to be mindful of security during design and development with code examples derived from Linux kernel fixes to bugs found by security scanners and automated fuzz testing tools.

SUMMARY:The Neuroscience of Diverse Teams and Navigating Open Source Ecosystems - Christy Consler\, Sustainable Leadership Advisors\, Inc.
DESCRIPTION:The promise of open source ecosystems to solve the world’s biggest technical challenges can only be achieved when diverse community members are able to effectively collaborate\, find win-wins\, and drive progress through consensus on a shared vision.While numerous studies show that teams with diversity of thought\, style\, and background drive superior results\, understanding HOW to skillfully leverage that diversity is hard.Add to that varied member interests\, unclear power structures\, and different personalities—and the technical challenges can seem easy to navigate by comparison.This presentation will demystify the process of building trust and collaboration by providing an actionable framework that attendees can immediately apply within their open source teams.Participants also will gain an understanding of the four main brain systems that drive diversity of thought and style\, and more importantly\, learn tools to practically apply this information so they can communicate more effectively\, bring out the diverse talents of team members\, and avoid common speed bumps that can slow down the progress of complex project teams.

DESCRIPTION:Linux networking has gone through many changes over the years\, and the ip filtering subsystem is no different. From ipchains\, to iptables\, and now to nftables\, which is quickly becoming the defacto standard for network filtering on Linux. This talk is intended to get users who have a basic understanding of networking an overview of nftables\, why it's a major step forward\, why it's taken so long\, and to get attendees the basics (including examples) they can take to deploy their own network filtering using nftables. This is primarily targeted as a teaching and 101 level discussion\, and to give attendees a starting point to go further from. Basic concepts like tcp/ip\, udp\, network flows and such would be good understandings to have coming in\, but the topics will be touched on briefly.

SUMMARY:AI Model Efficiency Toolkit - Abhijit Khobare\, Qualcomm
DESCRIPTION:AI\, specifically deep learning\, is revolutionizing industries\, products\, and core capabilities by delivering dramatically enhanced experiences. However\, the deep neural networks of today use too much memory\, compute\, and energy. At Qualcomm Technologies\, we’ve been actively researching and developing AI solutions with the goal to make artificial intelligence ubiquitous across devices\, machines\, vehicles\, and things. To this end\, Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) has open sourced the AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET) on GitHub to collaborate with other leading AI researchers and to provide a simple library plugin for AI developers to utilize for state-of-the-art model efficiency performance. The open source project is meant to help migrate the ecosystem toward integer inference because we believe this is an effective way to increase performance per watt.In this talk\, we will discuss why model efficiency is important and the challenges associated with running models on low-precision hardware. We will also introduce AIMET and its features\, discuss the goals of this open source project\, and show a demo of AIMET’s model compression features.

SUMMARY:SLIs\, SLAs\, SLD’OHs! Learning About Service Uptime from Homer Simpson - Mason Egger\, DigitalOcean
DESCRIPTION:Measuring service uptime can be a daunting task\, but not for the Simpsons! Viewers will leave with a clearer understanding of how to account for services\, how SLxs can define and guide what to monitor\, and how to implement reliability targets and error budgets; all told by fabled Springfield wisdom.Building services is important\, but what happens after they are built and running in production? How do we establish trust with our customers that our service will actually be available? Who creates these definitions and how do we measure them?Service Level Indicators (SLI)\, Agreements (SLA)\, and Objectives (SLO) are central to an operations mindset and foundational tools for effective Site Reliability Engineering. This talk will take you on a journey through Springfield as we discuss exactly what SLIs\, SLAs\, and SLOs are\, how to measure them\, what targets should be measured\, how to define uptime\, availability\, and acceptable error rates\, and what happens when they are breached.Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how to monitor and report for their services\, how SLIs\, SLAs and SLOs can aid in this process\, and how to implement them within their own teams.

SUMMARY:Code to Production - Kubernetes with Tekton and GitOps - Mario Vázquez & Ryan Cook\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:Git has emerged as the unifying language of DevOps. By being able to leverage the inherent capabilities of Git\, developers and operations teams can work together to build complex systems as their work is expressed and versioned in a declarative manner.Whenever changes are introduced\, actions\, such as triggering building and deploying\, can be orchestrated to apply the modifications.The same concept can apply to Kubernetes manifests\, such as Services and Deployments. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could push commits to your code and have Tekton Pipelines and Argo CD get these automatically deployed on your different environments? Enter GitOps.In this session\, attendees will be introduced to:- The basic concepts of GitOps and how it can be applied in practice using a tool called ArgoCD- Deploying your applications to multiple environments and tuning them for the target environments- Leveraging Tekton pipelines to build and test your code on Kubernetes

SUMMARY:Panel: Succession Planning for the Open Source Movement - Georg Link\, Bitergia; Dawn Foster\, VMware; Michael Downey\, Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) at the United Nations Foundation & Maria Cruz\, Google
DESCRIPTION:How well are we\, as an open source movement\, prepared to continue the legacy when the “first generation” retires?We want to have an open dialog with the audience about how the open source movement\, not just individual projects\, can continue. Ideally\, we would like to see us carry forward the lessons learned\, not repeat mistakes\, and build on the foundation we have today. Much knowledge is available across blog posts\, mailing list discussions\, and implicitly embedded in “how things are done”\, but that knowledge is almost as inaccessible as implicit knowledge. We should be worried about losing critical expertise\, experience\, and the network of the first generation in open source.The panelists will share their personal experiences with succession planning in open source\, good and bad\, and discuss implications. In an open dialog with the audience\, we want to discuss training and nurturing future leaders\, increasing diversity of leaders\, ensuring that next-generation leaders have a strong network\, avoiding the reinvention of the metaphorical wheel. The goal is not to remove anyone but ensure that the open source movement is prepared for the first generation to retire.

SUMMARY:DMA-BUF Heaps: Linux User-space Device Buffer Allocation and its Uses - Andrew Davis\, Texas Instruments
DESCRIPTION:The DMA-BUF Heaps framework is designed as a central user-space allocator for device buffers. Created with the goal of replacing various out-of-tree allocators such as PMEM\, CMEM\, MPM\, and ION with a single unified and stable API. After almost a year of upstreaming efforts the framework has been merged into the Linux kernel 5.6-rc1. This talk discuses the motivations for this work and the challenges and benefits associated with migrating applications and frameworks\, such as OpenCL\, OpenVX\, and Android Grallocs\, to use this new kernel API.

SUMMARY:Finding Sources of Latency on your Linux System - Steven Rostedt\, VMware
DESCRIPTION:In today's computer systems the level of complexity has risen such that when a task or response to an event takes longer than expected\, it is not easy knowing what the culprit is. The Linux operating system contains several utilities that allows a user to see where things may be held up. This talk will cover many of these utilities and briefly explain how to use them. From the hardware latency detector to the latency tracers. It will also discuss the new synthetic event interface that allows users to create a histogram on the time it takes any two events to occur.I have previously discussed the latency tracers but they are soon to be obsolete\, and the new synthetic event interface will be replacing them. There is still a lot more development going on with the synthetic events and this talk will briefly go over some of the new features that are yet to arrive.

SUMMARY:Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 - How Open Source Software and Linux is Powering the Next Generation of Robotics - Katherine Scott\, Open Robotics
DESCRIPTION:Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of mature free and open source software packages used by the robotics community to program robots. Recently ROS had its first major version upgrade in a decade to ROS 2. This new version introduces a number of changes and new features\, many of which simplify the development process and allow users to build virtual robots without ever touching a piece of hardware. ROS 2 is the version of ROS that supports Python 3 out of the box and has new additions that allow for high-fidelity simulations. Simulation makes learning advanced robotics topics more accessible\, as you no longer need to outfit a robotics lab and you can simulate cutting edge hardware for free. In this talk we'll cover the state of the open source robotics ecosystem and cover the changes made in ROS 2 to improve its simplicity\, stability\, safety\, and security. These features\, along with enhanced embedded hardware support\, are helping ROS become the de facto standard for the developers of autonomous vehicles\, drones\, industrial\, and agricultural robots. This talk will give the Linux community and update on ROS ecosystem and a starting point for learning how to use it.

SUMMARY:5 Years of Providing Root Shells to Strangers on the Internet - Stephane Graber\, Canonical Ltd
DESCRIPTION:5 years ago\, the LXD project decided to provide an online demo of its software.All that users need is a web browser and heading to https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/try-itThrough that URL\, they get root access inside a LXD container running on a shared server. They can then either follow a step by step guide or just do whatever they want until the session expires 30 minutes later.Since this page went live\, over 400000 sessions were created\, meaning over 200 strangers got root access inside a LXD container every single day.Most users follow our terms of service and just want to discover LXD.Most\, but not all...This talk will go through how the service is run and configured to avoid most common concerns and attacks while still offering something of value to users.We'll also cover some other places where properly configured unprivileged LXD containers are similarly used to run untrusted code by random strangers.

SUMMARY:Taming Cross-Region Latency in Geo-Distributed SQL Databases - Sid Choudhury\, Yugabyte Inc.
DESCRIPTION:Enterprises have three geo-redundancy options\, namely multi-zone\, multi-region and multi-cloud\, when deploying database clusters to power cloud native applications. Monolithic RDBMS like Oracle\, MySQL and PostgreSQL are unfit for such applications. Non-scalable architecture and bolted-on failover/repair (with inherent data loss) are the top two fundamental limitations of such legacy databases. Geo-distributed SQL databases pioneered by Google Spanner and its open source derivatives such as YugabyteDB have emerged as alternatives.However\, the number one concern developers cite with database clusters that stretch across three regions is the high cross-region latency incurred during database queries. This talk will highlight nine techniques that cloud native applications can leverage in geo-distributed SQL databases to reduce inter-node communication. These techniques range from simple design paradigms that are fully transparent to applications (such as linearizable reads without quorum and follower reads with timeline consistency) to more sophisticated approaches that require application-aware data management (such as colocated/interleaved tables and cross-cluster asynchronous replication).

SUMMARY:Open Source with a Security Mindset: Releasing with Protection - Brittany Erica Istenes & Michael Lacroce\, Comcast
DESCRIPTION:At first glance\, security teams and open source teams at companies seem to be at odds. Security is about locking down doors and securing infrastructure and open source makes apps more collaborative and transparent. So how can these two teams work better together?This becomes important as companies scale their use and adoption of open source and contribute code back to upstream projects or release their new projects. Open Source Program Offices need to work more closely with their security teams to achieve both open and secure work. We will share some best practices we adopted at the Comcast Open Source Program Office and how we have learned to balance reducing friction to doing more open source with securing what we release. We want to ensure that we are contributing more secure open source and reducing risk to users and to contributors alike.

SUMMARY:The Selfless Engineer - Ryan Thomas & Vasudha Prabhala\, Headspring
DESCRIPTION:A software engineer with great coding skills and great communication skills is a diamond in the rough. But maybe it’s high-time you shine. Even if you’re more comfortable interacting with software than with people\, you already have the tools to break out of the “introverted developer” box and advance to the next level. That’s because software engineers are great problem solvers at heart and effective communication is just another problem to solve. Becoming a better communicator is not impossible or even difficult. All it takes is a little ego-shedding and adapting to the communication styles of others. This talk will dig into why communication matters\, and how exactly to go about it. We’ll explore tactics for shedding the “self\,” putting yourself in another’s place\, and practicing patience and empathy so you can balance the energy of any conversation. You’ll learn how this impacts your interactions\, and how to channel those skills into your code to become a stronger software engineer. Don’t worry\, you can keep your INFP title\, but you might add some more impressive ones to the list in the near future!

SUMMARY:Enhanced POET: Open-ended Reinforcement Learning through Unbounded Invention of Learning Challenges and their Solutions - Rui Wang\, Uber
DESCRIPTION:Reinforcement learning (RL) is good at solving some hand-designed challenges. However\, in real-life applications such as robotics\, there are many edge cases that are impossible to design by hand\, and some of them are too challenging to solve from scratch.We introduce a novel class of RL algorithms (named POET) which combines the concept of open-endedness with RL. Such algorithms create increasingly diverse and challenging problems all by itself\, while automatically forming a curriculum that teaches RL agents to solve those problems. This talk covers our most recent significant enhancements to POET\, which is NEVER presented before: we enable POET to be applied to any general domains\, introduces quantitative measurement of open-ended progress\, and formulate a much more expressive environmental encoding. The combination of all of these innovation leads to the most open-ended demonstration so far: in a single run of the algorithm\, the capability of agents increase along with the difficult levels/diversity of the created tasks\, finally they solving extremely challenging tasks that cannot be solved by direct optimization or by learning through a hand-designed curriculum.

SUMMARY:Introduction to Embedded Linux Security - Sergio Prado\, Embedded Labworks
DESCRIPTION:Security is a key feature in every connected product. But the real question is: what do you want to secure? Do you want to protect the Intelectual Property? Or maybe the integrity of your product? Do you want to secure data at rest? And what about data in transit? These and other questions can be answered with a proper threat modeling process so potential threats can be identified and mitigated. In this talk\, an example of threat modeling to identify the security requirements of an embedded Linux system will be discussed\, and a wide range of tools and techniques to implement the security requirements will be presented\, including secure/verified boot\, data integrity and encryption\, authentication\, port scanning\, TPM and key management\, secure firmware update and patching\, secure coding\, sandboxing and containers\, TEE\, mandatory access control (SELinux\, AppArmor\, etc).

SUMMARY:A Collection of Deep Learning Packages for IoT Devices - Yihong Wang & Va Barbosa\, IBM
DESCRIPTION:Combining TensorFlow.js with Node-RED\, IoT enthusiasts and developers can now easily incorporate AI into an IoT application and deploy it onto their devices.Node-RED is an open source visual programming tool built on Node.js; it allows developers to easily wire together hardware devices\, APIs\, and online services. TensorFlow.js enables running deep learning models in Node.js. Bringing the two together\, we have developed a collection of deep learning packages that allow developers to compose apps in a user-friendly way and run the apps directly on the IoT devices.We will highlight the benefits of Node-RED with TensorFlow.js as a tool to engage developers\, and describe the collection of packages. We will demo on the Rasberry Pi and Jetson Nano\, showing how a TensorFlow.js model becomes a Node-RED node and creating engaging applications from scratch.The large collection of open Node.js packages and the availability pre-trained deep learning models can help to democratize access to AI in the IoT community.

SUMMARY:A Fresh Look at Toolchains and Crosscompilers in 2020 - Bernhard "Bero" Rosenkränzer\, LinDev
DESCRIPTION:The traditional way to build a toolchain for a Linux system is clear: Build binutils\, build a minimal gcc\, use that to build glibc\, build gcc with more features\, and start having fun.This is still by far the best documented way - but far from the only one.This talk looks at traditional toolchains as well as other options\, such as clang\, compiler-rt\, musl\, uclibc-ng and Bionic (who said none of Android's components are reusable in other systems?) - it talks about how to use different components and what advantages they may have in different settings from embedded to server.It also covers how OpenMandriva is going about unifying crosscompiler toolchains.

SUMMARY:Making Unprivileged Containers More Useable - Christian Brauner\, Canonical
DESCRIPTION:Unprivileged containers come with a range of security restriction enforced by the kernel. This includes not allowing the creation of character or block device nodes preventing a container from gaining access to e.g. any disk devices attached to the hardware or to write directly into kernel memory. The kernel will also prevent an unprivileged container from mounting most interesting filesystems. There are a wide range of other examples where the kernel access to interesting or crucial features to ensure the integrity of the system in the face of untrusted workloads for which unprivileged containers were designed.In this talk we will show how new kernel features can be combined to overcome these restrictions and thereby making unprivileged containers more useable and powerful in a secure way.

SUMMARY:Zedstore - Compressed Columnar Storage for Postgres - Soumyadeep Chakraborty & Alexandra Wang\, VMware
DESCRIPTION:Zedstore is an open-source compressed columnar storage layer for Postgres being developed from the ground up with the goal to be incorporated into core Postgres. Apart from supporting and optimizing for OLAP workloads\, it aims to support the entire feature set that Postgres' row store (heap tables) offers: MVCC compliance\, crash safety\, replication\, updates\, deletes\, singleton inserts\, all flavors of indexes\, vacuum and storage-aware-query-plans\, in order to be truly HTAP compliant. Zedstore offers a fresh take on column store design opting for B-Trees as the primary on-disk structure. Its flexible design allows for features such as column families or even its use as a compressed row store.This talk will introduce the kinds of workloads column stores are specialized for and detail how Zedstore performs on those workloads and dive into its unique architecture. The audience can expect insights into how Zedstore is benchmarked\, how one may monitor Zedstore deployments and open areas of development.

SUMMARY:Effective Observability with Open Telemetry - Paras Mamgain & Kiran Darbha\, IBM
DESCRIPTION:OpenTelemetry provides a single set of APIs\, libraries\, agents and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from application. You can analyze the traces and metrics using Prometheus\, Jaeger and various other observability tools.Open-Telemetry takes the best from the Open tracing and Open Census.Its a new\, open distributed tracing standard for application. With the widespread use of Microservice architecture\, it becomes very important to understand the role and importance of distributed tracing.It allows developers\, engineers to instrument their code\, their components\, their modules to leverage the Open Tracing which provides : Standardization of span management APIs\, inter-process propagation APIs and active span management APIs.It gives us the standards we need to make accurate\, turnkey distributed tracing a reality across modern software systems\, including OSS packages and other third-party code. It does this while allowing OpenTracing implementations to take control over both in-band and out-of-band encoding formats; this in turn gives the application owner the flexibility to switch (or add) tracing vendors with an O(1) declarative configuration change.

SUMMARY:Creating an Open Source Project in a Proprietary Industry - Olivier Crête\, Collabora
DESCRIPTION:Creating a new project is doubly challenging when the target industry has proprietary software as the norm. Taking code written as closed source and building a community around it is never easy\, but it's even more difficult when none of the developers have participated in Open Source projects before. Such is the story of SRT (Secure Reliable Transport)\, an Open Source protocol that has taken the TV contribution world by storm. This is the story of how we helped Haivision take its internally built SRT protocol and helped make it the main player in low latency transport of video.As an addition to previous versions of this presentation\, I will also explain how in this industry\, Open Source goes beyond what can be accomplished by mere Open Standards.I'll explain the kind of things that we had to take care of when creating a new Open Source project. Starting with an evaluation of existing software\, are we pointlessly re-inventing the wheel? Followed by a plan for a community\, with an appropriate choice of license\, a governance model\, a communication and collaboration infrastructure. And last\, but not least\, a solid commitment from the main sponsor.

SUMMARY:There Is No Store for Self-Driving Car Parts: Running The Ultimate Battery-Powered Device with Linux - Stephen Segal & Matt Fornero\, Cruise
DESCRIPTION:In the auto industry\, Linux is often relegated to use in infotainment systems. However\, at Cruise our self-driving vehicles contain a large number of custom embedded Linux devices. These can range from large\, server-class high-performance computers to small cameras and network switches. This creates a large challenge: how do we manage a build system that can allow teams to efficiently manage OS development across such radically different devices?In this presentation\, we’ll talk about the practices we’ve developed to tackle this complex integration problem. We’ll discuss topics such as customizing Buildroot to enforce commonality and maintainability\, the challenges of working with automotive suppliers that aren’t used to working with open-source software\, updating a heterogeneous complex system with swupdate\, and using hardware abstraction layers to maximize reuse across bootloaders\, Linux\, and the build system itself.

SUMMARY:Using MIPI DSI as Main Display Interface - Marcel Ziswiler\, Toradex AG
DESCRIPTION:The MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI) is the de-facto standard display interface featured by modern higher-end SoCs. Lacking the long-term availability of discrete MIPI DSI display panels most embedded systems rely on bridge chips converting to more common display interfaces like parallel RGB\, LVDS\, (e)DP or HDMI. Our generic system concept relies on DSI adapter boards integrating various such bridge chips. After introducing the Linux DSI subsystem this talk concentrates on the auto-detection of such DSI adapters based on parametrisation stored in EEPROMs. The U-Boot boot loader reads the EEPROM contents and chooses the applicable device tree overlay to be applied. The concept of DDC/EDID with hot-plug detect vs. a custom model-specific parametrisation is discussed. The talk continues covering the integration aspect of such DSI bridge chips within the Linux DRM stack. Various limitations of the DSI subsystem and possible solutions are discussed. The DSI bridge chip ecosystem is covered and we look into possible reasons only very few bridge chips are actually supported in mainline so far. The talk concludes with a live demo of our DSI auto-detection implementation.

SUMMARY:Xen Cache Coloring: Interference-Free Real-Time Systems - Stefano Stabellini\, Xilinx
DESCRIPTION:Virtualization is a key part of real-time and safety-critical systems\, including industrial and automotive. Embedded hypervisors can statically partition the hardware resources available on the platform\, and fully dedicate physical CPUs to software domains to minimize IRQ latency. This way\, a real-time OS can run alongside larger OSes without being affected by them.In reality\, even with best-in-class hypervisors\, real-time deadlines can still be missed due to the presence of a shared L2 cache across the multiple CPU cores. An application on one CPU core can affect the performance of another application in a different virtual machine by causing cache interference.The solution is cache coloring. This presentation will introduce the new Xen feature to achieve deterministic latency on Cortex-A systems with a shared L2 cache. Cache coloring enables memory allocations with entirely dedicated cache line entries to avoid any cache interference. The presentation will show how to configure a cache coloring Xen deployment and will demonstrate the benefits of the technology with detailed latency measurements and live demos based on the Xilinx Ultrascale+ MPSoC.

SUMMARY:Running Your Own Postgres Database-as-a-Service on Kubernetes - Lukas Fittl\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:Running a database is hard. And that's especially the case when you need tens or hundreds of databases that should be configured consistently\, and have capabilities such as HA\, backups\, monitoring\, and more.As someone who is part of a team that has built a solution in this space\, leveraging Kubernetes for the underlying cluster management\, this talk will be an introduction to the tools available today to run open-source databases\, and in particular PostgreSQL\, at scale.We'll review what solutions exist today for achieving this\, how they interact with Kubernetes concepts such as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)\, and what matters when deciding to pick a solution\, or when building your own.The target audience for this talk is both folks that need a database like PostgreSQL to run at scale\, with many servers\, as well as those that are just starting out\, but may have an interest in topics such as how to provide a database for micro services in a Kubernetes environment.

SUMMARY:Curtail Coercive Control Using Open Source Applications and Services - Lesley Nutall & Henry Nash\, IBM
DESCRIPTION:Cloud native technology has enabled the proliferation of apps that allow us to remotely access many aspects of our lives (e.g. our cars\, lights and heating in our house\, social media\, email\, etc). However\, it is a sad fact that there has been a rapid increase in these (well intentioned) capabilities being used in abusive relationships to exert coercive control. In a recent study\, 98% of abuse support workers reported that they had witnessed these capabilities being used in such relationships. This talk will outline research carried out on how relatively simple changes in application\, security and observability design when interacting with platforms\, such as Kubernetes\, can minimise the mis-use of such features. It will also discuss future work and open source tooling that may enable the highlighting of flaws in design\, ahead of deployment.To find out more\, visit: https://ibm.biz/fivePrinciples

SUMMARY:Open Source in Research and Reality - Wolfgang Mauerer\, Technical University of Applied Sciences Regensburg / Siemens AG
DESCRIPTION:Well-known\, large communities and open source projects like the Linux kernel are an often pursued goal of scientific analysis\, and questions of interest cover a broad range -- core OS design\, collaborative software engineering\, software architectural questions and community health\, to just name a few. However\, many research questions are biased towards what can be nicely published\, and not on the most pressing problems of projects.This leads to a gap between what OSS communities need to know\, and the insights science can provide. In this (likely opinionated) talk\, we discuss this gap from two often opposite sides: As a researcher\, the author has never understood why industrial belief in software engineering research seems to often stop at using design patterns\, and why industry does not try to benefit more from scientific insight. As an industrial practitioner\, the author has never understood why academia would need to tell industrial engineers that have participated in OSS projects for years what they have done\, post facto\, and why research does not listen more closely to what industry is interested in\, and needs to know. We suggest some possibilities to shrink the gap.

SUMMARY:Keynote Lightning Talk: Wyliodrin STUDIO: From Prototyping to Small-scale Deployment - Ioana Culic\, Teaching Assistant & Cosmin Daniel Radu\, Teaching Assistant\, Politehnica University of Bucharest
DESCRIPTION:Prototyping is the first step in building any commercial or industrial IoT solution. As this process needs to be fast\, various development tools especially developed for IoT prototyping have been implemented. Wyliodrin STUDIO is such a platform. It is an open source\, easy to use IDE for the Internet of Things that enables remote control over embedded devices and fast deployment of simple applications.While a good prototyping tool\, Wyliodrin STUDIO was designed as an educational tool to run simple applications on a limited number of devices.The purpose of this presentation is to give an overview of how we managed to expand Wyliodrin STUDIO so it covers the complete IoT development process. To achieve this\, we have implemented container-based technologies so applications can be easily deployed and managed on clusters of devices. The result is an open source platform that can be used for both prototyping IoT projects and managing small-scale industrial deployments of applications.

SUMMARY:Keynote Lightning Talk: An Open-Source Model Zoo for Analyzing\, Visualizing\, and Comparing Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents - Joel Lehman\, Senior Research Scientist\, Uber
DESCRIPTION:Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is an exciting paradigm for solving real-world problems. Most research aims to improve how well RL performs\, and much less effort focuses on understanding the products of deep RL -- often enormous neural network policies -- which is critical for establishing enough trust to deploy them in the real world. The open-source Atari Zoo project aims to catalyze research into understanding deep RL by reducing the barriers to entry for researchers and citizen scientists alike. A team at Uber AI trained popular RL algorithms at scale on simulated Atari 2600 games (the prototypical deep RL benchmark)\, and released models and code\, making it easy to load\, visualize\, and analyze such pre-trained models. Joel Lehman describes the Atari Zoo project and highlights surprising results from initial explorations and the exciting potential for what is still left to be discovered.

SUMMARY:Kubernetes as a Service - Open Source Cloud on Arm64 - Kevin Zhao & Xinliang Liu\, Linaro
DESCRIPTION:Arm64 is becoming a very emerging architecture in the enterprise market. More and more developers want to try the Arm64 with Kubernetes\, but there is no good choice for them to get the proper resources. Besides\, there are no totally Open source cloud solutions for Cloud Operators.Linaro Developer Cloud is a purely open-source cloud on Arm64\, which can offer Kubernetes service for developers who are interested in arm ecosystem. It uses OpenStack as infrastructure\, Ceph as the storage\, and Kubernetes is an overlay service on top of them. Besides\, the Kubernetes cluster leverages the capability of authentication\, storage and load balanced by Kubernetes cloud provider of OpenStack. Everything happens on Arm64.In this session\, we will elaborate on the structure of the arm64 open-source cloud. We will cover the efforts to support Kubernetes as a service both from the infrastructure level(OpenStack LB service and Cluster provisioning service) and Kubernetes cloud provider side. We will also show a demo of it. This open-source cloud will be a good template for Arm64 to achieve its first-class citizen in the cloud-native area.

SUMMARY:Keep Your Project Healthy: Grow Your Contributors - Kendall Nelson\, The OpenStack Foundation & Guinevere Saenger\, GitHub
DESCRIPTION:Open Source is a difficult concept to teach people because there isn’t anything in life that is truly ‘free’. Even more difficult than explaining what open source is in the first place\, is teaching ways to openly collaborate and work together with people from other companies and places in the world.When you consider that some open source projects literally span the globe\, and are worked on by thousands of contributors\, this job gets even more difficult. In this talk\, you will hear about the best practices Guinevere and Kendall have discovered through their work on the Kubernetes New Contributor Workshop and the OpenStack Upstream Institute trainings that teach attendees how to contribute to these projects. The struggles they have faced and overcome are applicable to all open source projects developing training on getting new contributors started.

SUMMARY:Reproducible Builds and Hash Equivalence in the Yocto Project - Joshua Watt\, Garmin
DESCRIPTION:As embedded Linux devices get more complex\, many questions arise about the process of constructing these systems and how it can be improved. Can these complex systems be built more efficiently to reduce development time? How can developers be assured that these systems can be built reproducibly to ensure software supply chain integrity? Joshua will highlight two new features in the latest release of the Yocto project specifically designed to address these questions. The first feature is hash equivalence which reduces build times by collectively detecting when tasks have rebuilt unnecessarily and preventing rebuilds of downstream tasks. Joshua will explain how this feature works\, how to apply it to your own projects\, and what to expect when you do. The second feature is build reproducibility testing\, which ensures that the project has binary identical outputs from one build to the next. Joshua will describe how these tests work\, what they currently cover within the project\, and how to enable them for your own projects. Taken together\, these features improve the Yocto project’s unique ability to effectively construct complex Linux embedded systems that are cost effective and secure.

SUMMARY:Code Size Compiler Optimizations and Techniques for Embedded Systems - Aditya Kumar\, Facebook
DESCRIPTION:Code size of embedded application has been a concern for a very long time. While storage becomes cheaper and smaller\, developers find creative ways to increase code size by adding features or unnecessary software engineering. Compilers have come a long way in optimizing applications for code size. While most compiler optimization work were focused on application performance\, we have seen increase in the code size optimizations in recent years.In this presentation I'll talk about classical as well as recent compiler optimizations for code size\, a few of which I implemented in the LLVM compiler. Some optimizations (hot cold splitting\, function entry instrumentation) require collecting data from the field while the application is running. I'll provide an overview of how those compiler techniques help reduce code size. I'll also talk about some tips and techniques (compiler flags to reduce code size\, tuning of compiler options like inline threshold)\, that help reduce binary size. Having knowledge of the code generated by the compiler and the instruction set architecture can help engineers chose appropriate programming abstractions and idioms. I'll talk about both gcc and LLVM.

SUMMARY:Using Hardware Security Modules to Protect your Block Devices - Reinhard Buendgen\, IBM
DESCRIPTION:In Linux\, dm-crypt is the technology of choice to encrypt data on disks. For encrypted data the major challenge is to protect data encryption keys such that the system can be automatically started i.e. w/o a user interactively entering some kind of password.We have implemented a solution to use dm-crypt with keys that are protected by a hardware security module (HSM). At the open source summit in 2017 we have described our kernel functions and a potential approach for integrating our solution in cryptsetup. This presentation will present the actual key management solution that was accpeted upstream consisting of a combination of extenstions to cryptsetup and new tooling to manage a key repository.In addition\, this presentation will discuss the main challenges to over come in integrating HSM protected keys in to the dm-crypt framework and continue with more advanced topics in operating such disks like accessing the right HSM\, providing redundant HSM access\, allowing to encrypt the root partition\, and management of dm-crypt keys needed when HSM master key changes.

SUMMARY:Building Trusted Apps with the Open Enclave SDK - Jordan Hand\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:Today\, most data is encrypted at rest and in transit; but very little data is encrypted while in use\, leaving it vulnerable to malicious actors. To address this gap\, Microsoft contributed the Open Enclave SDK (OE-SDK) to the Confidential Computing Consortium in 2019 and is working across the industry to develop new standards for encrypting data-in-use.The OE-SDK enables trusted applications to run in hardware-isolated enclaves even on an untrusted machine\, providing an interface to allow developers to write an application once and run it across different Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)\, e.g. Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone.This talk will cover the architecture of the OE-SDK\, introduce the audience to the basics of writing an enclave application\, provide a project update\, and show developers how they can get involved with the OE-SDK community.If you attended the OE-SDK BoF last year\, this talk will go deeper on how to write different types of OE-SDK apps. We will also discuss our journey to supporting a second platform (TrustZone) and the challenges in supporting different paradigms under one SDK. Finally\, we will give an update on the last year of work in the SDK.

SUMMARY:Control Flow Integrity in the Linux Kernel - Kees Cook\, Google
DESCRIPTION:Like all C/C++ programs\, the Linux Kernel regularly suffers from memory corruption flaws. A common way for attackers to gain execution control is to target function pointers that were saved to memory. Control Flow Integrity (CFI) seeks to sanity-check these pointers and eliminate a huge portion of attack surface. It's possible to do this today with the Linux kernel (or any program) with Clang/LLVM's CFI implementation.This presentation will discuss how Android is using Clang's CFI in the Linux kernel for recent phones\, how it is being upstreamed\, and what you can do to use CFI yourself. We will explore what Clang actually inserts for code\, data\, and symbols to protect indirect calls\, what needed fixing in the kernel to support it\, and what's still missing. We'll wrap up with a short demo of CFI foiling a kernel attack.

SUMMARY:Classic Tools for the Modern Age: Introducing Wash\, the Cloud Native Shell - Michael Smith\, Puppet\, Inc.
DESCRIPTION:Cloud infrastructure has made it more difficult to understand what's happening across multiple systems\, how our systems interact\, and even what we're running at this particular moment. More distributed systems have sprung up to help you manage that.But sometimes setting up those tools is as complicated as the infrastructure you're running. Or they're not flexible in just the way you want. We still spend our days on the command-line\, using a suite of tools that do similar things against similar types of infrastructure. But these tools are often inconsistent or inscrutable.This talk reimagines how we build command-line tools for cloud infrastructure to make them more composable and transferable between systems. I will describe how the Wide-Area Shell (Wash) applies these ideas in designing a new shell experience. I will also share examples of how tools built around this idea can be used in novel ways to help understand your cloud infrastructure.I've given a similar talk\, but this will be longer and highlight more ways the shell design enhances usability.

SUMMARY:Store This and That: The Case for Serverless Datastores - Ricardo Aravena\, Rakuten & Amarjit Singh\, KIOXIA America
DESCRIPTION:In the last few years\, we have seen the rise of serverless applications for event-driven workloads. We know that serverless functions need to create a container or VM and then release their resources once event requests are served. Such characteristics inhibit running stateful applications in a serverless approach.This session will explore how serverless stateful applications can become more of a reality with Kubernetes and newer storage standards such as NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF)\, RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE)\, and Container Storage Interface (CSI). Can you attach the same storage backend to every function creation without any major performance penalties? Can a function reuse that storage as a way to read\, write and update data? What type of stateful workloads are better candidates? Can we tie it together with serverless frameworks like Knative and OpenFaas?The audience will come away with an understanding of how to take advantage of Kubernetes\, open-source serverless frameworks together with cutting edge storage standards to run basic serverless stateful workloads.

SUMMARY:Connect and Grow your Community through Meetups - Carol Chen\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:Open source communities collaborate in a multitude of ways - chatting on irc\, submitting issues and contributing code on GitHub\, discussing and sharing ideas on reddit and other social channels. Face to face gatherings add another dimension to that\, where community members can learn and share their experiences. Local meetups provide a venue for people with similar interests to socialize and connect. However\, organizing meetups is not trivial. How does one encourage and motivate the community to arrange meetups\, and to keep the momentum? In Carol's one year with the Ansible community\, the number of active meetups in Europe has doubled. These meetups are community driven\, rather than Red Hat. Find out how she uses metrics to analyze the situation and needs\, and the steps she is taking to reach the goals of connecting with even more community members. Learn from their mistakes and challenges (100 RSVPs and only 20 turned up?)\, plus some tips to make your meetups more inclusive.

SUMMARY:Go RISC-V Go: The State of Software Development Tools for RISC-V - Khem Raj\, Comcast
DESCRIPTION:This talk covers current status and new developments in open source software development tools for RISC-V. In particular\, it will go over the various toolchain options available for RISC-V software development and how to get them or to build one on your own. Some of the specific technology: Clang/LLVM has newly added backends for RISC-V. In addition\, there is now a golang port\, which is still out of tree but headed towards upstream acceptance. Additionally\, GCC is working towards the GCC-10 release\, with several new enhancements to its RISC-V backend. The LLVM backend also means Rust can now cross-compile to the RISC-V architecture. The MUSL C library also has a new RISCV 64-bit port. Additionally\, we will discuss the state of tools on the RV32 ecosystem\, progress on the glibc port for RV32\, and Yocto Project support for RV32 in its core\, where QEMU RV32 port is usable for doing application port.Distributions have been making steady progress with RISC-V ports as well. We cover the status of existing ports\, incl. Debian\, Fedora\, SuSE\, Gentoo\, and the Yocto Project. Along with this\, we also address challenges and work pending in critical areas like node/v8 Backend & Java/JRE\,etc.

SUMMARY:The Bad Guys Just Broke My Crypto - What Do I Do? - Kris Chaplin\, Intel UK
DESCRIPTION:The scene is a classic.You've followed all industry standards\, used strong cryptography\, and keep your boot loader and kernel up-to-date with LTS versions. You constantly upstream\, and offer frequent updates to your customer base.Everything is going well until suddenly\, a fundamental security vulnerability is found. Not in the kernel\, and not in the hardware cryptographic accelerator that you depend on for system performance. No this time it's a much bigger problem. The baddies have solved prime number factorization with quantum computers and every security system that relies on traditional cryptography is vulnerable.So how do you respond? It's not as if you can change the crypto accelerator once a product has shipped! You can move to a new quantum-secure algorithm in software\, but how do you keep the performance up\, and keep using all the same APIs and middleware that has been in your system for years? And how can you react quickly?In this presentation\, Kris Chaplin shows some technology and techniques to do just this. All that is required is some thought up-front when designing your next system\, and much more can be achieved - even after your product has shipped!

SUMMARY:Upstreaming a Qualcomm SoC - Vinod Koul\, Linaro
DESCRIPTION:People don't talk of "Upstreaming" and "Qualcomm chipsets" in the same sentence. Even if they do\, it is mostly to point out millions of lines of out of tree code in downstream kernel!Only constant thing in nature is the change it brings in\, similarly we have changes in the status of the Qualcomm chipsets upstream. There has been a lot of work done by Linaro and Qualcomm Innovation Center to ensure a better story for Qualcomm chipsets upstream.This talk shares the story of upstreaming of baseport for one of the latest generation premier tier SoC SM8150 aka Snapdragon SDM855The SM8150 support was added to mainline kernel in v5.4\, this talk focuses on how the drivers were ported from downstream tree released on codeaurora.org.This talk shares the experience gained while porting\, upstreaming and the tips and tricks learned. This will help other developers who are struggling to get upstream working on the Qualcomm devices.

SUMMARY:A USB Model for Sharing Host Internet Connectivity with Devices - Daniel Berliner\, Xaptum
DESCRIPTION:Daniel Berliner will introduce a new USB model for sharing host internet connectivity with devices. This model allows for data to be passed without the device having to know the details of its host’s network.Most internet connected USB devices either have specific host drivers or dedicated networking hardware to connect to the internet. Several models exist for allowing USB devices to transmit data over an existing network\, but they describe how to send Ethernet packets as if the connected device were a distinct entity on the network. With the model described in this talk\, the host creates sockets for the device to manage\, so the complexity of managing a distinct network entity is eliminated.This talk will discuss how this is accomplished\, why it is useful to allow devices to connect to the internet through their host and some of the challenges that came up during implementation.

SUMMARY:Breaking Out of the Proprietary Cage: Real-time Data Warehouses Come to Open Source - Robert Hodges\, Altinity LTD
DESCRIPTION:SQL data warehouses are the foundation of high performance analytic solutions on structured information like market tick data or network flow logs. Until recently this type of application has been dominated by proprietary solutions. The situation changed radically with ClickHouse\, an Apache 2.0 SQL data warehouse that meets or exceeds performance of Vertica\, Redshift\, and other closed-source implementations. This talk starts with a quick history of data warehouses including recent open source offerings. We then dive into ClickHouse and study optimizations it uses to achieve record-setting speed. These include compression\, vectorized query processing\, SIMD instructions\, and efficient pre-aggregation through materialized views. Finally we'll show how open source tools like Kafka and Grafana combine with ClickHouse to create complete solutions that offer sub-second response on datasets running into trillions of rows and ingested at millions of events per second. The resulting stack enables users to add real-time analytics to any application without the constraints of proprietary licenses. It's a key open source innovation for the age of big data.

SUMMARY:Running Sensitive Workloads on Untrusted Hosts: Project Enarx - Mike Bursell & Nathaniel McCallum\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:There are many sensitive workloads that you shouldn't entrust to a public cloud to run\, or may even have concerns about running on on-premises systems. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel's SGX and AMD's SEV provide a great opportunity to help secure these workloads\, but they're not easy to use.Enarx is a project which aims to make it simple to deploy workloads to a variety of different TEE technologies in the cloud\, on premises or elsewhere\, whilst ensuring that your application workload is as secure as possible. It is written in Rust\, and provides a WebAssembly (WASI) runtime. This session will outline the various parts of the sensitive workload deployment problem and how Enarx is architected to solve them\, including attestation\, a key pain point when considering deployment on TEEs. It will also include a demo of the current state of Enarx and talk about opportunities for involvement in the project.Enarx is a fully open source project\, under the Apache 2.0 license\, and a part of the Confidential Computing Consortium\, a Linux Foundation community project.Differences from previous version:- new code\, architecture\, demo- accent on open source & ecosystem

SUMMARY:Pwned By Statistics: How Kubeflow & MLOps Can Help Secure Your ML Workloads - David Aronchick\, Azure
DESCRIPTION:While machine learning is spreading like wildfire\, very little attention has been paid to the ways that it can go wrong when moving from development to production. Even when models work perfectly\, they can be attacked and/or degrade quickly if the data changes. Having a well understood MLOps process is necessary for ML security!Using Kubeflow\, we will demonstrate how to the common ways machine learning workflows go wrong\, and how to mitigate them using MLOps pipelines to provide reproducibility\, validation\, versioning/tracking\, and safe/compliant deployment. We will also talk about the direction for MLOps as an industry\, and how we can use it to move faster\, with less risk\, than ever before.

DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes has changed how we think about application development\, but it has also introduced additional complexity into the way we manage microservices. What is a simple way to extend Kubernetes for highly-available applications at scale?Ingress management is an important part of your configuration and operations. When services are exposed outside a cluster\, you need to take care of authentication\, observability to maintain SLOs\, auditing\, encryption and integrations with other third-party vendors\, amongst other things.This session will take you on a deep dive into the architecture and design of an Ingress layer. Ingress Controllers implement authentication\, load-balancing\, traffic throttling\, transformations\, caching\, metrics\, and logging across Kubernetes clusters.In this talk\, Marco will take the audience through a live demo of how to leverage a Kubernetes Ingress Controller for:- Basic Ingress- Auth Protection- Traffic Transformation- Rate-limiting- Encrypted credentials- Native gRPC routing- Admission Controller

SUMMARY:librtpi: Conditional Variables for Real-Time Applications - Gratian Crisan\, National Instruments
DESCRIPTION:Safely sharing data between high priority real-time threads (or processes) and lower priority threads is a common problem in designing real-time applications. A common way to solve this bounded producer/consumer problem is by using conditional variables (condvars).The glibc implementation of condvars prior to 2.25 requires a patch to fix a priority inversion with an internal lock. More recently\, in glibc versions 2.25 and newer\, the condvar code was refactored to address a POSIX compliance issue. This in turn broke that fix and modified the implementation in such a way as to prevent real-time usage of glibc condvars by introducing new type of priority inversion.The librtpi project was formed to address this problem and provide a narrow real-time specific implementation of the condition variable mechanism in a way which can be readily used in lieu of the glibc implementation. It is designed to support priority inheritance on the associated mutex by default and more importantly always wake the waiters in priority FIFO order.We will discuss the current state of the project\, as well as the long term strategy with a goal to increase the awareness and participation in the project.

SUMMARY:Linux Kernel: Stop Over-Cooling! - Thara Gopinath\, Linaro Inc. & Ram Chandrasekar\, Qualcomm Innovation Center Inc.
DESCRIPTION:Everyone knows why embedded SoCs should not overheat and why software has to monitor for rising temperatures and implement mitigation frameworks. But\, should software monitor for falling temperatures as well? What if there are hardware limitations that impedes SoC operations at lower temperatures?This presentation aims to give an overview of some hardware requirements in modernSoCs\, such as Qualcomm Snapdragon processors that call for monitoring of falling temperatures and corresponding mitigation needs. Further\, the presentation explores how well suited(or not) the existing Linux Kernel thermal management frameworks are to handle this requirement. The presentation identifies the gaps in the existing frameworks and provides a first-pass solution to these gaps. Lastly the presentation discusses the status of few of these solutions that are already posted in the respective mailing lists.

SUMMARY:The OpenAMP Project & its Working Groups: Standardizing the Interactions Between Operating Environments in a Heterogeneous Embedded System - Nathalie C. Chan King Choy & Stefano Stabellini\, Xilinx
DESCRIPTION:SoCs (System on a Chip) are becoming more heterogeneous\, with multiple processor clusters and special-purpose accelerators. So\, AMP (Asymmetric MultiProcessing) systems need to run different operating environments side-by-side on the same chip.OpenAMP is a framework to enable development of software applications for AMP systems.It allows operating systems to interact within a broad range of homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures and allows AMP applications to leverage parallelism offered by multi-core configurations.The OpenAMP Project works to standardize aspects of embedded heterogeneous software through open source projects. Its working groups tackle messaging (rpmsg\, virtio)\, lifecycle management (remoteproc)\, configuration standardization (System Device Tree)\, common interfaces for hypervisors and AMP\, and application services.It recently became an "official" open source project with a Board\, TSC\, governance\, working groups\, and members. It is hoping to reach those facing similar challenges and welcomes new participants.This talk will describe OpenAMP Project efforts\, how you can engage\, and the steps being taken to create an open environment for collaboration.

SUMMARY:Open Source IoT Networks to Make an Impact Around the World with Project OWL - Bryan Knouse\, Project OWL
DESCRIPTION:Project OWL brings connectivity to the people\, places\, and things we care about most. Born out of the IBM Call for Code\, a global hackathon focused on developing solutions that can help communities mitigate the impact of natural disasters\, Project OWL has developed a hybrid hardware/software solution that can quickly bring online network infrastructure in a place that has lost it. The DuckLink is an IoT device running the “ClusterDuck Protocol” - an open source firmware that will be released as an official Linux foundation project this March. This protocol turns simple IoT devices into mesh network nodes that can be used as communications infrastructure when traditional networks go offline. This session focuses on three stages of open source IoT mesh network firmware development. First addressing the state of IoT and how a recent wave of cost effective devices enable scaled techniques in network connectivity. Second\, we explore the development of an interoperable IoT firmware that aligns with the current state of hardware and programming techniques. And last we will discuss how to build a global open source community around these new technologies with eyes on the future.

SUMMARY:Integrity Policy Enforcement: Full System Integrity Verification - Deven Bowers\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:Code integrity is widely recognized as one of the most effective security mitigations for modern threats\, especially those targeting high-value systems. Authoring\, maintaining\, and enforcing a system-wide integrity policy can be challenging for system builders today.We'll present our work including a new LSM\, Integrity Policy Enforcement (IPE)\, and in-kernel signature verification of DM-Verity root hashes. We'll also demonstrate a fully worked example and discuss challengessuch as dynamic code generation and providing authentication mechanisms around data integrity.The IPE LSM provides a flexible integrity policy mechanism that allows integrity verification requirements to be specified for all files on the system and from an arbitrary number of filesystems. A variety of integrityverification mechanisms may be utilized as the framework is easy to extend.

SUMMARY:Marketing Open Source - Deirdre Straughan & Rikki Endsley\, Amazon Web Services
DESCRIPTION:Your open source project competes with millions of others for users\, contributors\, and perhaps even financial support. To stand out from the crowd\, your project needs marketing. If that term makes you shudder\, or if you simply don’t think you know how to “do marketing\,” this talk will help you understand the why and the how of getting started with open source marketing.In this session\, two veterans of open source content and marketing share their insights and experience helping to launch and promote open source projects and communities\, focusing on how small- to medium-sized projects and organizations can do more with less and get better results.Attendees will leave with an understanding of why marketing is essential for open source projects\, a checklist for getting started\, and an overview of a few practical marketing tools that will help.Deirdré has previously delivered versions of this talk (see bio). This will be significantly different in including new team-mate Rikki\, who brings her own perspective and experience. We will focus on the needs and resources of small-to-medium projects and organizations\, including useful takeaways like a getting started checklist.

DESCRIPTION:I will provide the attendees a short introduction on how to use both OpenSource projects Knative (https://github.com/knative) and TektonCD (https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) to build a Cloud Native Application.This might be the first experience to some students to open source technologies to understanding and building Cloud Native Applications\, a skill that a lot of developers wan to get started.The tutorial will have the students use a Kubernetes Cluster (provided) on the cloud\, and have a guided tutorial where they will fork a github repo that contains some web server code that implements a REST API. It will will take this source code and build a container image and push it to a container registry using TektonCD Pipelines. Then have the pipelines deploy the application using Knative Serverless abstraction\, this will allow the application scale to zero containers when there is no http traffic into the application\, and scale back up when new traffic starts to flow.They will have the ability to do automation using DevOps by creating a gihub webhook that triggers the pipeline to run any time there is a code change in the git repo.

SUMMARY:Kubernetes as a General Purpose Control Plane: Scaling on Kubernetes - Hasan Turken\, Upbound
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes style APIs are becoming popular as it works great as a general purpose control plane. One can build operators on top of it to declaratively manage resources living outside of the cluster.But how to scale when we want to run multiple isolated instances of such an operator? Do we really need a full fledged Kubernetes Cluster for each or can we run only a subset of control plane components by considering we are managing external resources?In this talk\, we will discuss the minimal control plane components when we want to use Kubernetes as a general purpose control plane. Building on top of that\, we will propose a lightweight solution to run multiple isolated control plane instances as tenants on a single Kubernetes Cluster. At the end\, a live demo will be shown that provides a practical example of the solution proposed.Thanks to its great extensibility story\, Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for running distributed applications instead of just a container orchestration tool. Kubernetes operators are getting more and more popular not only to automate in-cluster tasks\, but also to manage external resources declaratively with custom resources.

DESCRIPTION:This talk will give an overview of the open-source tools being created by the KernelCI project to help catch problems before they end up in the Linux kernel. Follow a patch from its toddler days on the mailing list through its “school-age” years of stress and testing in linux-next and mainline and its eventual “graduation” into a long-term stable (LTS) kernel. Throughout the lifecycle of a patch\, there are many opportunities for testing\, and we’ll discuss all the ways KernelCI is involved. There may even be stories of “grown-up” patches that need to go back to school.We’ll cover the tooling used by KernelCI to build\, boot and test the kernel\, an overview of how a wide variety of hardware is used to validate the kernel\, and how data is collected during each phase in order to provide reporting\, analysis and visualization of results.

SUMMARY:Safety\, Security\, Quality: Artificial Intelligence versus Common Sense - Wolfgang Mauerer\, Technical University of Applied Sciences Regensburg / Siemens AG
DESCRIPTION:Embedded Linux is a standard core component of systems deployed in challenging and critical scenarios. Machine learning and statistical techniques are increasingly used to ascertain or even predict various quality properties -- the number of open issues to judge reliability\, or maximum latencies for real-time systems --\, or to improve development and maintenance processes: Techniques to automatically select patches for back-porting or to identify security critical fixes have recently been suggested.While machine learning undoubtedly has its advantages\, it is by no means a panacea for solving all engineering issues that have been around for decades\, and issues like lack of explainability or over-confident trust in results often cause unease. But it is also unwise to dismiss them just because they differ from traditional engineering approaches.In this talk\, we survey recent uses of ML techniques in OSS systems development and maintenance\, address their benefits and disadvantages\, and give recommendations on how especially industrial system integrators and solution providers can enjoy the benefits of new ML-based engineering methods without suffering from new problems.

DESCRIPTION:Open source is a flourishing ecosystem which for many companies is opening up the doors to agility\, innovation and strategic competitive advantages driven by lower total cost of ownership and faster time to market.With great power comes great responsibilities: Security\, legal and operational risks with open source which can cost companies their hard-earned business as well as reputation.With increasing reliance on open source we need to understand the risks involved with those open source components and ensure that its easy for dev\, security and legal to collaborate together to ensure that opensource adoption increase is safe and secure. Good news is that devsecops practices can help in mitgating those risks for ex:-1) Continuous scanning for vulnerabilities can go a long way to mitigate these risks2) Security testing early in the SDLC (shift left) and with continuous integration in the pipeline software component analysis can be accomplished systematically3) Vulnerability disclosure programs should be in place to ensure4) Bill of material for every application can track vulnerable dependencies5) License and vulnerability checks can be enforces on download

SUMMARY:Postgres 12: Choose Your Own Adventure\, All Demos Edition - Robert Treat\, credativ
DESCRIPTION:Often new database releases focus on brand new features and shiny additions\, but Postgres 12 focused more on performance and feature optimization\, with a goal of producing a finely-tuned\, well-polished implementation of existing PostgreSQL capabilities.Of course\, when a new release includes shiny new features\, the hype cycle makes it easy to advocate for\, but Postgres 12 is a more subtle release. True\, there are some shiny new features (JSONPath anyone?)\, but even better\, this release ups the game for many of the features that got headlines the last few release cycles\, providing a more polished experience for Postgres' many capabilities.Join me as we take a look at some of my favorite changes that will make your life better\, like improvements to Common Table Expressions\, B-Tree index improvements\, and better partitioning support\, in this latest and greatest version of Postgres. This won't just be a bunch of boring slides\, we're doing this as 100% Demos\, and since it is all done live\, we can choose to focus on the features you most want to look at. So come take a look at what's new in Postgres 12\, and see what this Open Source database can do for you!

SUMMARY:Exploring 20 Years of Linux and Open Source on the Mainframe - Elizabeth K. Joseph\, IBM
DESCRIPTION:Curious about how VM (Virtual Machine) technology that got its start in the 1970s allowed Linux to be run on the mainframe by a group of hobbyists in the late 1990s?Starting in the 1970s and then covering the past 20 years\, this talk will begin with the hobbyist and independent roots of virtualization and Linux on the mainframe. It will speak to specific moments in the timeline that exemplify the progress made by various Linux distributions and open source software projects to port software to Linux on the mainframe since the first Linux patches were released in 1999.Today there is an entire product line of mainframes that exclusively run Linux (RHEL\, SLES\, or Ubuntu). With Linux\, you get access to the vast ecosystem of open source software that’s already been ported to the mainframe architecture (s390x)\, with more being ported every month.Finally\, we take a look at the Open Mainframe Project\, which has a series of open source projects targeted specifically at more traditional mainframe workloads and improving usability. Zowe\, for instance\, helps create a consolidated API for accessing resources and workload on your system and Feilong is a z/VM connector that allows you to manage your virtual machines with familiar open source tooling like OpenStack. There are even connectors for Jenkins that allow you to integrate CI/CD pipelines with your workloads.

SUMMARY:Driving Community-based Innovation at Large Company -- 5 Lessons Learned - Barton H George\, Dell Technologies
DESCRIPTION:Driving grass roots innovation at a large company is never easy. When you target a customer segment that the company views as esoteric (open source developers) and whose expectations and methods are foreign to that entity it gets even trickier.Barton George will take you through Project Sputnik a skunkworks effort at Dell to create a community-driven Linux laptop and how ultimately it has been the building and engaging of that community that has been the core of the project's success. He will walk you through the internal selling and education needed to get management comfortable with the project’s three guiding principles\, 1) publicly engage and involve the community\, 2) maintain transparency and 3) give back . He will also talk about the strong internal head winds that the project encountered along the way and how its demise was often a hair's breadth away.At the end of the presentation Barton will share the team’s five key learnings that have enabled them to not only survive but thrive in an often hostile environment.

SUMMARY:Horovod: Distributed Deep Learning for Reliable MLOps at Uber - Travis Addair\, Uber Technologies\, Inc.
DESCRIPTION:At Uber\, deep learning powers increasingly many business-critical use cases\, including ETA prediction\, dynamic pricing\, fraud detection\, autonomous vehicles\, and many more. New data coming in every day is used to build bigger and more accurate models\, but at the cost of increasing the time to train on a single machine. Data processing tools like Spark are used to scale data extraction\, transformation\, and feature engineering\, but efficiently training a deep neural network requires specialized hardware and cannot be arbitrarily parallelized.In this talk\, you will learn how Uber is solving these challenges using Horovod\, the open source framework created to make distributed training of deep neural networks fast and easy for TensorFlow\, PyTorch\, and MXNet models. You’ll see how Horovod Spark Estimators are used to seamlessly insert deep learning into Spark pipelines\, dynamically blending CPU and GPU resources with Spark 3’s resource-aware scheduling.This talk is for machine learning engineers and data scientists looking to speed up their model training lifecycle\, and MLOps engineers interested in adding deep learning as a first-class citizen to their production ML pipelines.

SUMMARY:How to "Operate" Like a Ninja with Kubernetes Operators - Avni Sharma & Akash Shinde\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:With the advent of cloud-native applications and Kubernetes it became imperative to leverage Kubernetes for our custom needs and operations. The idea is that when you have an application\, like a database like Postgres or Cassandra\, etc\, any complex application needs a lot of domain-specific knowledge. To be able to make the most of Kubernetes\, you need a set of cohesive APIs to extend in order to service and manage your applications. We can achieve this with the help of Operators. An Operator is a method of packaging\, deploying and managing a Kubernetes application. It helps to extend the types of applications that can run on Kubernetes by allowing developers to provide additional knowledge to applications that need to maintain state.This session would be a beginner session on Operators\, covering its basic principles\, concepts and an overview of how operators work:Kubernetes Objects/ResourcesScenarios where these primitives aren't enoughThe relation between Kubernetes primitives and operatorsCustom Resource DefinitionsCustom ControllersRunning the OperatorFuture of operators

SUMMARY:Building a Secure IoT Environment on Top of TockOS - Alexandru Radovici & Alexandru Vochescu\, Politehnica University of Bucharest
DESCRIPTION:In recent years\, RTOSes have become more and more popular among IoT developers. Though not as capable or feature rich as Linux\, RTOSes provide a great framework for developing complex IoT applications that run on low power devices. Most of these systems\, work as a single piece of software\, with no clear separation between kernel\, drivers and user space. All of them are written in C/C++\, which makes them susceptible to the most common security bugs like dangling pointers\, buffer overflows and memory leaks.TockOS is a new RTOS entirely written in Rust. We believe that what started as a "Stanford & all" research project has the potential to a game changer in the IoT environment. In this talk\, we will describe the "crossover" architecture of TockOS\, as it has separated kernel\, drivers (capsules) and user space\, and our ongoing journey of porting it to crossover MCUs based on i.MX RT series. In our quest to build a development environment around TockOS\, we will present our experience to run a ported version of JerryScript on top of it and provide a simple SDK for peripherals.

SUMMARY:How to Protect Your Privacy by X.Org Security Module on the Desktop - Junghwan Kang\, The Affiliated Institute of ETRI
DESCRIPTION:On your desktop Linux\, X.Org a.k.a X11 is closely related to security and privacy issues because it manages and controls the input and output data from a keyboard and mouse to a screen. However\, X.Org has been faced with several security concerns by design\, although most Linux distributions are shipping it. On the desktop based on X.Org\, it is not difficult for adversaries to intercept your keystroke and clipboard data\, as well as screenshot and screencast\, which are often misused for surveilling your behavior.In this talk\, Junghwan Kang will introduce an X.Org Security Module (XSM) for protecting the user’s privacy on an X.Org based desktop. He looks into a mechanism about the clipboard\, screenshot\, screencast\, and X session record/replay closely in terms of information leakage. He also describes the pros and cons of methods for resolving the security issues at an X client and X server level. Lastly\, he shows how to protect your privacy against the malicious behaviors by XSM\, as well as how to extend it as desired.

SUMMARY:Lessons Learned Applying Static Analysis Tools to an Open Source Elliptic Curve Crypto Library - Zane Beckwith\, Xaptum\, Inc.
DESCRIPTION:Static analysis tools can dramatically improve the reliability of software\, but are often dismissed as onerous to setup and use. Static analysis is particularly useful for cryptography projects and other critical systems\, which tend to have a tight focus and require very clean code style. This talk discusses tools and approaches that were helpful during the development of an open source elliptic curve pairing-based library\, ECDAA [1]\, for privacy-preserving signatures such as are used by the FIDO Alliance. The emphasis of the talk is on concrete lessons for improving the reliability of critical code while fitting seamlessly into a modern development process. Tools discussed include venerable standbys Valgrind and cppcheck\, as well as modern examples like scan-build and Infer. The lessons learned are of interest to developers of many types of projects\, not just cryptography libraries.[1] www.github.com/xaptum/ecdaa

SUMMARY:10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card - Bradley Spengler\, Open Source Security\, Inc.
DESCRIPTION:At the 2010 edition of the Linux Security Summit\, Brad Spengler gave a presentation entitled "Linux Security in 10 years"\, outlining a set of goals that would impact Linux security in positive ways\, based on his experience of having already accomplished most of the items via the grsecurity project. The goals were mostly designed around the concept of kernel self-protection\, something Mr. Spengler has been involved in since 2003 and which the KSPP made part of its namesake. Now 10 years since that presentation\, Mr. Spengler is delivering a report card on the level to which the goals were met. Being still intimately familiar with changes occurring upstream via the KSPP and the developer community as a whole\, suggestions for future improvements to kernel self-protection will be provided as well.

SUMMARY:SELint - An SELinux Policy Static Analysis Tool - Daniel Burgener\, Microsoft
DESCRIPTION:Writing SELinux policy can be challenging for many users\, leading some to either disable SELinux entirely\, or use policies that do not adequately support their security goals. While SELinux is a helpful tool for creating customizable security policies\, its value as a security mechanism is only as strong as the policy that it enforces.This talk demonstrates a new tool\, called SELint\, which can assist in writing scalable and maintainable policies by alerting about common policy issues. The use of this tool can help speed up SELinux policy development and result in more secure policies.The talk discuss motivation\, examples of problems found by the tool\, maintenance and security benefits\, and the broader question of what steps the security community can take to help users use available security mechanisms correctly.

SUMMARY:Automatically Securing Linux Application Containers in Untrusted Clouds - Anjo Vahldiek-Oberwagner\, Intel & Dmitrii Kuvaiskii\, Intel Labs
DESCRIPTION:Computing on secret data is challenging with today’s cloud service provider (CSP) offerings. CSP have full visibility into their client’s workloads and data while run in a VM or container and shielding against other tenants. On the contrary\, confidential computing (CC) techniques (e.g.\, Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX)) offer a reverse sandbox. These techniques shield the workload and data from accesses by the underlying system software (e.g.\, OS or VMM) and hardware attacks. Thus\, preventing CSPs from accessing secrets. In addition\, CC provides remote attestation to verify the integrity of applications.In this talk we will present Graphene Secure Containers\, a technique to automatically wrap an unmodified Linux application packaged in a container image to execute inside Intel SGX using the Graphene LibraryOS and allow users to verify application integrity via remote attestation.
