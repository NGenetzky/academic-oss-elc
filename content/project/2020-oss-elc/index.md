- Automotive people use OSTree
  - the beauty with OSTree is that you even store delta, basically. In pratice you typically can afford to have A+B+C+...+recovery

### Ftrace preempt RT

> Welcome Everyone @here to the Ask the Expert Session with Steven Rostedt, Open Source Engineer, VMware!
> Steven Rostedt is the creator and current maintainer of Ftrace (the official tracer of the Linux kernel). He's also one of the original developers of the PREEMPT_RT patch, and today maintains the 5.4-rt real-time stable tree.
> Ask Steven about tracing, real-time, or anything else that has to do with Linux kernel development.

- Q: What are the top userspace tools for interfacing with Ftrace? Do you use those kinds of tools frequently?
  - [slack](https://osselc.slack.com/archives/C0140RTKZ71/p1593455023040800)
  - A: Are trace-cmd and kernelshark the way to go to use ftrace ?
  - A: Yes! I think you answered that question for me :slightly_smiling_face:  And kernelshark 2.0 will be out soon that will have a lot more visualization features! And trace-cmd will hopefully turn into a library as well to let other tools access ftrace.

- Q: I am trying to troubleshoot an issue with SLOB, there is a lot of traffic there, but I want to track allocations/deallocations and modification of slob/kmemcache objects. my q is - what is the best way to do it for a busy piece of code? and how do you track modification of an object and not just allocations/deallocations, and if you do it with printk - where and how to save all those millions of printk messages so that i can go back in history and review the lifecycle of any particular slob/kmemcache object?
  - [slack](https://osselc.slack.com/archives/C0140RTKZ71/p1593455349057500)
  - Use trace_printk() which writes into the tracing buffer. Use trace-cmd record to capture that data live into a file and examine it offline later. Use -b option to increase the size of the per cpu buffers (it's in 1K increments, 1000 is 1M).

### Sandbox

> Linux seccomp is a simple, yet powerful tool to sandbox running processes and significantly decrease potential damage in case the application code gets exploited. It provides fine-grained controls for the process to declare what it can and can’t do in advance and in most cases has zero performance overhead.
>
> The only disadvantage - to utilise this framework, application developers have to explicitly add sandboxing code to their projects and developers usually either delay this or omit completely as their main focus is mostly on the functionality of the code rather than security. Moreover, seccomp security model is based around system calls, but many developers, writing their code in high-level programming languages and frameworks, either have little knowledge to no experience with syscalls or just don’t have easy to use seccomp abstractions or libraries for their frameworks.
>
> All this makes seccomp not that widely adopted, but what if there was a way to easily sandbox any application in any programming language without writing a single line of code? This presentation discusses potential approaches and their pros and cons.

### Yocto Channel

#### how to ensure you always reuse SSTATE AND DL_DIR from populate sdk

> Robert Berger (ReliableEmbeddedSystems)  11:09 AM
> `bitbake core-image-minimal`
> 11:10
> `bitbake core-image-minimal -c populate_sdk`
> 11:10
> if you do this from the same shell DL_DIR and SSTATE will be reused anyways
> 11:10
> `-c populate_sdk_ext` for extensible SDK

## Embedded linux channel

### container_of

> Brandon Streiff  12:26 PM
> Fun piece of trivia: container_of isn't exclusive to Linux; the Windows DDK has it too, though they call it CONTAINING_RECORD and it has nowhere near as many type-safety checks as it does on Linux.

#### RiSC V

- risvc quickstart
  - riscv on QEMU

### Kernel stable talk

- https://ossna2020.sched.com/event/c3Rm/safeguards-in-the-stable-kernel-process-sasha-levin-microsoft

> There is a common misconception that while Linus's tree is heavily tested and validated, the Stable and LTS trees aren't reviewed or tested at all. This talk aims to change this misconception.
>
> In reality, Stable trees are not only heavily tested, but the testing they are being subjected to is much more similar to "real world" workloads that the kernel will have to endure once it's released.
>
> We will go over every step a patch goes from the point it's sent to the mailing list, to after it was included in a stable tree, highlighting the process which makes it very difficult to introduce bugs into the Stable trees.

  - It's an integration tree that pulls various development branches of the kernel. See this (slightly older) writeup on the topic: https://lwn.net/Articles/289013/

## Wednesday

### Wyliodrin STUDIO: From Prototyping to Small-scale Deployment

- Ioana Culic, Teaching Assistant & Cosmin Daniel Radu, Teaching Assistant, Politehnica University of Bucharest
- wryliodrin.studio

> Prototyping is the first step in building any commercial or industrial IoT solution. As this process needs to be fast, various development tools especially developed for IoT prototyping have been implemented. Wyliodrin STUDIO is such a platform. It is an open source, easy to use IDE for the Internet of Things that enables remote control over embedded devices and fast deployment of simple applications.
>
> While a good prototyping tool, Wyliodrin STUDIO was designed as an educational tool to run simple applications on a limited number of devices.
>
> The purpose of this presentation is to give an overview of how we managed to expand Wyliodrin STUDIO so it covers the complete IoT development process. To achieve this, we have implemented container-based technologies so applications can be easily deployed and managed on clusters of devices. The result is an open source platform that can be used for both prototyping IoT projects and managing small-scale industrial deployments of applications.
